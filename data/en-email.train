ham call for papers politeness theory and language in the mass media this is a call for papers that explore linguistic politeness and social interaction in the mass media . in the introduction to the second edition of politeness , brown and levinson write , " we believe we happen to have stumbled on an area where many orthogonal aspects of social life converge in a set of crucial preoccupations in social interaction . " brown and levinson state that politeness is at the heart of those preoccupations . while there have been numerous studies of linguistic politeness since brown and levinson 's original paper , there has been little attention paid to politeness theory in discussions of language in the mass media . we believe that the mass media provide a unique yet ubiquitous arena through which to explore linguistic politeness because of the often ambiguous nature of social interaction in the mass media . it is our interest in the nature of social interaction in the mass media that provides the impetus for this book project . we also believe there is a need for theories of media discourse based on sociolinguistic perspectives . we are seeking original essays to include in a book volume that examines aspects of linguistic politeness based on data collected from the mass media . we would especially like to encourage submissions based on data from languages other than english . the intended audience of the book will be undergraduates , graduate students , and scholars in the areas of sociolinguistics , anthropological linguistics , linguistic pragmatics , ethnography of communication , sociology and communications . please forward an indication of interest and a one-page abstract of the proposed contribution by april 30 , 1998 to : prof . troi carleton 1200 holloway drive , department of english , san francisco state university , san francisco , ca 94132 , e-mail : troi @ sfsu . edu or prof . robin queen , english department , kent state university , kent , oh 44242-0001 , e-mail : rqueen @ kent . edu . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - robin m . queen english department kent state university kent , oh 44242-0001 tel : 330-672 - 2219

ham some months ago there was an extended discussion of the proposal made in the fifties by swadesh that there are certain lists of meanings which have the property that the words expressing them are lost at a fairly constant rate per millennium in all languages , in particular , a certain 100 - meaning list where the rate is around 86 % . while noting that bergsland and vogt have adduced examples where the rate seems to be lower , i pointed out that i had not found any examples where it was clearly higher . jacques guy referred to the eastern greenlandic data discussed by bergsland and vogt in current anthropology in 1962 , but , having just carefully read this paper , i see that they state that , while they surmise that the rate here was higher , they cannot calculate what is was ( presuumably because there are no sources for greenlandic that are old enough ) . moreover , the purely conjectural rate of 72 % which they mention is still low enough for the purposes of the original discussion we were having about this , namely , to assure that in a family with enough ramification there would be a substantial portion of the original vocabulary reflected in at least two descendants after far more than 10 , 000 years ( provided each language was independely losing 28 % of the original vocabulary per millennium ) . i do n't have the numbers handy , but jacques , who is better at this anyway , can probably whip some up . but i should also add that bergsland nd vogt 's data are also consistent with many other assumptions , notably , that the rate of retention in e . greenlandic was 86 % , but that it was substanitally lower in some other eskimo languages ( because all they have is the result that e . greenlandic is as different lexically from w . greenlandic as the two together are from yupik , which makes no sense given the family tree if the rates are the same eveywhere ) . but this could be due to slower vocabulary loss in yupik ( or even in the common ancestror of e . and w . greenlandic , or both ) just as well as to faster loss in e . greenlandic . so there is no justification that i can find for bergsland and vogt 's or guy 's assumption that the " prolem " lies in a faster rate of loss in e . greenlandic .

ham moderators ' message a very happy 1995 to all our subscribers ! as you can see , linguist is back on line - - on the 8th , not the 5th as we had hoped , but we are now up and running at our new address . remember : those of you who post to linguist @ tamvm1 . tamu . edu can continue to use that address . but those of you who used to post to linguist @ tamsun . tamu . edu must change either to the . . . tamvm1 address or to linguist @ tam2000 . tamu . edu the latter is our new editorial address . the . . . tamsun address is now worse than useless : the machine itself has been taken off line by texas a&m , so any messages sent there will simply disappear into an internet black hole . they will not be forwarded to us . the new year 's issues start with this issue : 6 . 1 . however , the listserv swallowed some of the issues we posted on dec . 20 and is just now sending them out . so you probably received some issues of volume 5 ( 1994 ) only today . this is not what we intended - - indeed , we worked hard to clear the mailer and post all the messages we had received before we shut down on dec 21 . we realize that some of them had deadlines . however , listserv malfunctions are simply not within our control . the texas a&m sysop took a long ( well-deserved ) ( and , we hope , energizing ) christmas vacation . and , until his return , the listserv would not free the issues we had posted . and that , by a lightening transition , brings us to a few remarks on maintaining free discussion on linguist . as linguist grows , it becomes potentially more powerful - - some might say " threatening " - - by virtue of its role as an information source . it 's natural that controversial policies and postings should generate concern ; and last year we received a number of complaints , protests , and editorial suggestions . we tried to respond to every message individually ; but we 'd also like to publicly explain our policies and our current thinking about some of the issues that arose . if any of you care to respond , we can continue this discusson on linguist . * we received several requests that we check the accuracy of controversial claims and allegations before we post them . however reasonable this sounds , unfortunately it simply is n't possible . linguist processes 50-70 messages a day ; last year we assembled and posted 1600 issues ( as those of you with overfull mailboxes know ! ) ; and we get over 1000 database requests a week , about 1 / 4 of which require some kind of administrative interchange . we ask our 3 student editors to check messages for civility ( more on this below ) ; but they do n't have time to check anything which is not immediately before them on the screen . so there is no way that we can strive for the standards of accuracy of paper journals . and , of course , we aren ' t a journal ; we ' re a discussion list . the only effective check on the accuracy of any posting is the discussion itself . so the moral is : - - read with a little scepticism - - and , if you see an inaccuracy , post a correction * the preceding applies , of course , to _ professional _ content in postings ; we can't be responsible for the accuracy of anyone 's claims about the number of words for " snow . " nor - - and this is the problematic area - - can we check claims about anyone 's or any institution 's decisions , opinions , or conduct . we will make every effort to ensure that any such posting has professional relevance , is temperate in phrasing , and ( if at all possible ) does not mention names . we also try not to publicize controversies having only personal relevance , since we do n't want linguist to become simply a forum for private grievances . but more than that we can't do . * about more widespread grievances : we have gotten many protests about cutting off discussions that criticize specific schools of linguistics . our problem with some of these has been that the criticisms were anecdotal , ( sometimes ) devoid of academic content , and sounded personally aggrieved ( see above ) . also , adherents of the schools under attack were telling us they no longer felt welcome on the list . so - - not wanting linguist to become a grievance forum or a cause of unnecessary divisiveness in the discipline - - we cut off the discussions . but we admit that there are good arguments on the side of free speech . so we have decided at least not to cut off discussions abruptly . instead , we will warn " next - to-last posting on x " before we send out a " last posting " message . and we will post any responses on x received in the interim . also , we 'd like to reiterate that any discussion that could compare schools or theories and stick to the academic issues would be very welcome . we are not committed to protecting any school from _ scholarly _ criticism ; and , in fact , we would tell any protestors that this is a discussion list , and if they feel attacked they must defend themselves through discussion . * about civility : we never intended to become a kind of electronic miss manners , and , frankly , it often feels like a very strange role for your uncouth moderators . however , we ' re committed to keeping postings civil in tone because ( 1 ) more than one academic list has ( literally ) gone down in flames - - i . e . , the list has disbanded because the discussions got too personal and heated ; and ( 2 ) , as much as possible , we 'd like everyone - - not just the brave or foolhardy - - to feel comfortable entering a linguist discussion . so we do occasionally return postings with a request that the writer revise toward a less-inflammatory tone . ( we realize , of course , that what is / is not inflammatory is a judgment call ; and our judgment may be wrong . ) however , we have returned very few postings ; and - - interestingly - - we have never received anything but cooperation from the writers . * * * * * * so - - as we ' ve said before - - we think linguist subscribers , all 5700 of you , are a remarkably reasonable , tolerant , and generous set of people . if you have comments or suggestions about the editorial policies we ' ve sketched out above , we would like to hear them . have a very happy new year ! - helen & anthony
ham thanks to the following people who kindly responded to my inquiry into work which attempts to apply j . r . firth 's notion of ' context of situation ' to studies of discourse : tom craven gudula stegmann graham mcgregor joe foley koenraad kuiper richard ogden in summary , it appears that although firth 's notion is familiar to many sociolinguists , discourse and conversation analysts - as evidenced in references typically appearing in overviews on the notion of ' context ' - surprisingly little work has been , or is being , actually undertaken on the topic . a reference where this phenomenon is exemplified is the introductory chapter in duranti , a . & goodwin , c . ( 1992 ) ( eds . ) rethinking context . cup . koenraad kuiper reports that he has a forthcoming paper which offers a reappraisal of the origins of the term ' context of situation ' ; graham mcgregor has conducted an ( unpublished ) study of person-reference which incorporates firth 's notion into his analytical approach . i shall be happy to inform readers of the list of my future uncoverings of applied firthian linguistics . alan firth aalborg university , denmark

ham dear subscribers : it 's the holiday season here in the usa , so we want to extend good wishes for the festive season and also to let you know that linguist will be " on vacation " from december 20 ( midnight ) to january 5 , 1995 . we ' re taking a break this year because we have been plagued with technical problems all semester : first our mailer started wildly duplicating and triplicating messages ; then we began having problems ( still unsolved ) telnetting from emu to texas a&m ; and now we are being moved to a new machine at texas a&m . ( come to think of it - - why did we say this was going to be a " holiday " ? ? ) we will be spending the break doing what we can to ensure that 1995 is less technically " interesting " . we want to thank all of you who have been patient with late postings , duplicate postings , and lost messages from september to december . and we wish to extend hearty thanks to our assistant editors , ron reck , ljuba veselinova , liz bodenmiller , and ann dizdar , who have manned the front lines in our battle with technology : it is because of their excellent work that linguist was able to continue all semester despite the revolt of the machines . some of you may be interested to know that linguist now has 5700 subscribers , who have posted this year 's 1500 messages from approximately 60 different countries . may all 5700 of you have a prosperous and happy new year ! helen & anthony

ham why must this kind of stuff be decided by a vote ? since obviously ipa membership does not equal interest in the matter and never will , all that will be achieved if some of us join the ipa just to force this issue , is that it will be " packed " in some other way than the way it is now , but it will never be representative . why not let the invisible hand of the " market " of ideas operate freely instead ? as fewer and fewer people use ipa 's made-up symbols , either that organization will become completely irrelevant , or it will make up its own mind to respond to the " market forces " , or perhaps some other group will step in and by proposing a system that is manifestly better than anyone else 's , achieve standardization that way . i really think that if a few of the top names in phonetics got together with the editors of a few journals , they could probably come up with something . it could also simply come from anywhere else : if someone were to publish a truly superior system and people started using it . finally , in reality , it seems that certain trends are occurring anyway and that in particular the resistance to the hachek and the use of the corresponding ipa symbols are on the wane . if we can put up with the inconsistencies of american vs . canadian vs . british spelling , we can probably do just as well here . and if we are gonna worry about something , i would worry more about those cases where te same symbols have different commonly used meanings like ' j ' and ' y ' . alexis mr
ham after attending a meeting , i heard someone say , " the acceptance of this plan will depend on its oversight . " i immediately thought of the meaning : " an unintentional omission or mistake " ( ahd ) . what was intended , however , was another meaning : " watchful care or management ; supervision " ( ahd ) . the latter meaning , i think , is becoming the more common one , but it still startles me . in the same way , synonyms may become antonyms in compounds . " to oversee " is quite different from " to overlook . " i would also point out that nonstandard " borrow " for " lend " is still heard . it may have about the same distribution as " learn " to mean " teach . " up to at least the sixties , english textbooks for high schools carried stern admonitions for both . so these uses must have been quite common . finally , there is the famous " bad " of black english , which signifies its opposite . antithetical meanings may be common in slang for their shock value . " man , she 's one tough babe , " could indicate two quite contrasting , if not opposite meanings .

( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources ( e . g . connect wordnet to celex ) , what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . draft program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza louise guthrie roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum paper submission - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : gill callaghan , fao yorick wilks dept . computer science university of sheffield regent court 211 portobello st . , sheffield s1 4dp uk electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or html . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to ( hamish cunningham - hamish @ dcs . shef . ac . uk ) even if they submit in paper form . an electronic submission should be accompanied by a plain ascii text . # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if also submitted electronically ) # note : anything you 'd like to add # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper # . . . . . . important dates paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) march 15th 1998 paper notification april 1st camera - ready papers due may 1st dalr workshop may 27st
ham it seems to me that for whatever reasons , the fact that there are so many references to chomsky by non-linguists ( let 's ignore the linguists for now ) shows that the field is at least recognized as a legitimate area of intellectual inquiry - - ( after all , even oxford decided a few years ago that they should have a professor of linguistics - - after a long debate to be sure ) this is a cause for exhaltation - - not snyde remarks or comparisons to stalin and mao . and linguists of whatever stripe or theoretical persuasion should recognize that our newly recognized status is due to a great extent to the advent of generative grammar and chomsky . for various reasons i have met a number of nobel laureates over the last ten to fifteen years , and each one on learning i was a linguist asked " do you know noam chomsky ? " and each remarked at some point that he thought chomsky was one of the great intellects in history . a much better response than being asked " how many languages do you speak ? " while that may still be the layperson 's view of our field , it is no longer the view among scientists and academicians across the board . vicki fromkin
ham these are notes after the recent discussions of karl teeter , amramer , sally thomason , after the aaa meetings sessions on distant language reconstructions , and also in response to part of mr . poser 's message of 14 december . first , most of the discussion of karl teeter i can agree with wholeheartedly except in the use of any of his criteria as absolutes . even grammatical things can be borrowed ( as sally pointed out ) . people do in practice * * * correctly * * * accept a language family such as uto - aztecan as essentially proven , even when no grammar has been written for the proto-language , or when only parts of a grammar are written . on the one hand , nobody would be disturbed much if it turned out that one of the assumed uto - aztecan languages was originally from another family , with truly massive borrowing from uto - aztecan . the overall hypothesis of a uto - aztecan family would not be shaken . on the other hand , asking the question how much of the grammar of the proto-language has to be written reveals the non-absoluteness of the criterion . only a tiny bit ? that might be subject to one of the special cases in which some morphology and other grammar were borrowed ( sally 's general type of example ) . so , again , karl is right in general , but wrong if any single criterion is taken as an absolute ( unless circularly many criteria are combined by feats of legalese into a single criterion ) . i would like to modify amramer 's statement in exactly the same spirit : ) we cannot demand a detailed morphological reconstruction ) until the languages are accepted as related . this is too strong . it is not quite the same as ramer 's ) but surely he does not mean that a comparative grammar is a ) prerequisite to a reconstruction ; it is part of a reconstruction . in practice , an extensive comparative grammar is indeed written as part of a reconstruction ( ramer 's second wording above , not his first above ) , but it is not likely to be written unless * * * both * * * of the following two conditions are fulfilled : 1 ) the languages are in fact related ( makes the grammar easier to write ) 2 ) enough scholars believe that the languages might be related and so put effort into establishing their links . it is some unwarranted discouragement of the second which needs to be dealt with in our field . ramer is right that some linguists do discourage attempts to prove what has not already been proven . no risk-taking , in other words . good researchers , attempting to write a grammar of altaic for example , will report all of their results , both for genetic relatedness , for borrowing , and for a host of other questions they will not even have thought of when they started their research . some researchers evaluate only the hypothesis they started with . very often the differences of viewpoint amount to nothing more than an elevation of what one does oneself into the " true " or " real " work of the field , instead of recognizing that it takes a number of different contributions . i will illustrate from karl teeter 's recent messages , with no malice intended , because i am absolutely sure he intends none himself . in modifying his wording to take account of amramer 's point that of course people do properly classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences , teeter writes on 10 december : " since it is clear that everybody 's first approximation to linguistic history begins with such classification . what i say is just that you cannot reconstruct languages on this basis . " ( please note the words " first approximation " in this . that you cannot reconstruct languages on the bases of classification alone seems to me a tautology . ) later in the same message , teeter reverts to the more absolute statement : " on the contrary , my contention ( not my invention ) , is that the only way to establish that languages are related is to write a grammar of the proto - langauge and show how it developed into different later grammars . " ( please note the words " the only way " and " establish " . using these words does not change the fact that uto - aztecan is * * * correctly * * * accepted as a proven family without teeter 's criteria being satisfied . ) on 8 december , teeter wrote : ) " systematic correspondences of sounds in the vocabularies " may prove ) a connection between languages , which is certainly an interesting ) first step , but there the real work of comparative grammar starts : [ then teeter mentions four possible explanations , only one genetic ] ) until one can exclude the first three factors , one has proven ) nothing at all regarding genetic relationship . teeter discounts the enormous work of discovering likely language families in the first place , trivializes that as not the " real work " and establishment of systematic sound correspondences as proving " nothing at all " regarding genetic relationship . on the contrary , that does prove a grouping as a legitimate candidate for genetic relationship , and often the nature of the sound correspondences found will also have made one or more of the alternatives less probable . the work of comparative-historical grammarians is " real work " . so is the work of those who spend enormous hard-working hours sifting potential cognates to discover potential sound correspondences . do teeter and others really have no knowledge of how much work that takes ? at no stage is something ever completely proven in an absolute sense ( not even after a comparative grammar is written , because of the potential for undiscovered problems of the kind noted by sally thomas ) . all stages of the process contribute to the end result . all stages are equally " the real work " . proof is always incremental , not nothing , not complete and absolute . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i turn next to mr . poser 's message , and to other information gleaned at the aaa meetings . perhaps mr . poser will be surprised that i am enthusiastically in favor of anyone correcting any errors in any claims of language relationship or language structure , including mr . poser 's mention of kimball correcting errors in muskogean , even or especially if that means that a greenberg claim about pronouns in amerind is weakened . it is actually claims about morphology where i expect greenberg is least likely to have succeeded in contributing something . i thank mr . poser for the bibliography i can check against my lists of corrections and for this note on muskogean pronouns . i also agree with mr . poser that the criticism of errors in data does not rely on the mere authority of the critic . ( that was not my point about appeals to authority , so one of mr . poser 's paragraphs was not directly relevant . my earlier point about appeals to authority remains . ) i did not indicate ( as mr . poser 's message suggests ) that critics complained of errors when they could not back them up . what i did say was that they claimed greenberg 's errors made the method worthless , without bothering to test whether correction of the errors would actually lead to a change in his conclusions , and without promptly providing the data so others could carry out such a test . ) from conversations , i would judge some are still reluctant to face this test , the one required by a part of their claims . ( even if their claims on this point prove wrong in some degree , because the conclusions of greenberg 's method mostly remain the same even after errors of those kinds are corrected , it still will not follow that greenberg 's methods produce valid results on a regular basis . please notice how careful it is important to be with notions of proof for or against anything . ) in conversation with bob rankin at the recent aaa meetings i indicated i was glad greenberg had made the attempt at morphology , with his 3rd - person alternation between / y / and / t / as a putative relic irregularity , but i was equally likely to end up believing that he had discovered a new typological fact , a preference for these unmarked segments and recurring conditions under which they might alternate in more or less the same way , which might indicate that the same phenomenon could arise by chance repeatedly . we are always dealing simultaneously with possibilities of genetic relationship or convergent evolution . as a general warning about the danger of throwing out hypotheses too early because they are " obviously " cases of chance lookalikes or convergent evolution , an article " common pathways of illumination " by stephen jay gould of harvard , in natural history magazine , december 1994 pp . 10-20 , discusses the origins of eyes in different phyla of the animal kingdom . he states that this had been a classic case in biology , used to show convergent evolution of originally unrelated organs to serve the same function . however , the dna specialists have gotten their hands on this one , and apparently it is * * * the same dna * * * which is regulating important parts of the production of eyes in these various phyla , barring of course a few changes in a few amino acid codes . this dna is therefore genetically inherited ( and we are talking as far back as the common node on the family tree of drosophila fruit flies , squids , and humans ! ) . if this line of argument holds up , we have quite a revolution in thinking on our hands . ( such thinking can of course go far overboard too . ) " chance lookalikes " certainly do exist massively . sound symbolism is a typological basis for their recurrence . the too-easy use of " chance lookalikes " to reject comparisons can however also be just like the too-easy use of " substrate " and many other ways of purporting to explain phenomena , but in reality merely naming them without doing the hard work of really explaining them . as another factual contribution to the discussion of greenberg 's errors , bob rankin clarified for me at the aaa meetings that he had looked at greenberg 's original notebooks , and that apparently what happened is that greenberg had a single flexible flap in his notebook bearing the language names , and sheets which he matched up against that to enter data for particular lexical items . this is a mechanism subject to errors of the two pieces of paper slipping vertically relative to each other , and in fact there were rather a large number of such errors . it was errors of rows rather than of columns ( as i loosely had assumed without ever bothering to ask if rows or columns ) . mr . poser originally asked on 9th november whether " limitations [ of the comparative method ] had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of emote relationships . . . " please take careful note of this wording , as mr . poser changed the wording in his message of 14 december , when he asserts no example has been given . i gave mr . poser an eyewitness account satisfying the wording he used . i stand by that eyewitness account . ( i do not like naming names ever in these matters , but mr . poser 's assertion could be answered only by an eyewitness account . ) none of mr . poser 's supposed rebuttal in his recent message is at all relevant to that claim , though it is relevant to another claim , an absurd one , that i did not make . ( as in his previous message , mr . poser mixes several different wordings of what are quite radically different hypotheses . any extended discussion of these variants would not be relevant to any of our central points , so i omit them . ) to be specific about that absurd claim i did * not * make , i quite agree with mr . poser that some of the same people also criticize greenberg 's hypotheses based on the factual data . i have never denied that , and in fact took pains to refer to other good work by the same people , and have always emphasized the importance of having corrections of data . mr . poser 's conclusion was : ) it thus appears , as i thought , that there are no real examples of perceived ) limitations of the comparative method being used as the basis for rejecting ) proposals of genetic affiliation . since i gave an eyewitness account of such an example of the perceived limitations being used as one basis for rejecting proposals of genetic affiliation , mr . poser can only maintain his original assertion by converting it into a different assertion as he has here , namely that there is no case of a person using those perceived limitations as " the " ( read " the only " ) basis for rejecting such proposals . i will simply repeat that in the case to which i was eyewitness , the tone of the presentation was quite clear that the absurdity of the time depth was sufficient * * * in and of itself * * * to rule out the legitimacy of attempting such distant comparison . ( a critique of errors in greenberg 's data is not directly relevant to this point , even if engaged in by the same person . ) apparently mr . poser wants his allies to be persons who not only do good work , but also do nothing wrong . but we cannot posit such a division between the " holy " and the " unclean " , like the caste distinctions of traditional india . no one has the right to take such a position vis a vis other good-faith researchers , however much they may disagree with data , results , or methods . i gather from some conversations at the aaa that some of the people involved have become more moderate since the earlier years in these matters , at least in their public statements . that is certainly all to the good . there are also small beginnings of developments of method which may turn out to be relevant to our current limitations . i am perplexed by mr . poser 's discussion of the supposed rule of using only three-consonant matches never merely two-consonant matches . although i used siouxan - yuchi , because some amerindianists are considering this , the point does not depend in the slightest on whether one believes these two particular nodes are related or not . perhaps someone can propose another alternative ( i would suggest looking for one in tibeto - burman , where perhaps only one consonant , one vowel , and tone would be available , and yet the genetic relations are in some cases secure . ) i agree with mr . poser that it is better to have three consonants than two , and precisely because it helps to avoid chance resemblances . as i stated in the previous message . that means that the only difference between us is that mr . poser will consider treating the preferred method ( 3 consonants ) as the only permitted one : ) if ( probably contrary to fact ) , matches of three consonants are ) necessary to exclude chance , . . . i do not see why we should be ) unwilling , in that case , to conclude either that they are not ) related or that , if they are , the relationship is not demonstrable . the problem here is the notion that such a particular rule * could even conceivably * be " necessary to exclude chance " . no rule is necessary to exclude chance . a large number of procedures and methods can * * * help * * * to exclude chance . except in the most difficult cases of all , probably most single rules can be violated , and there will still be enough other ways of excluding chance that a good result can be achieved . it is this fossilization in the response to expansions of the methods available as part of " the comparative method " which is damaging to increasing the rigor as well as the power of our field . it is encouraging to see sessions on distant language relationships . i firmly believe some of these sessions would not be occurring nor would there be so much work on studying methods , if greenberg had not published that book . some of the growth of interdisciplinary cooperation and communication was also in the process of happening anyway , and greenberg just accidentally published at this time . ( i am not trying to credit him with causing all of this interest . ) i particularly liked john colarusso 's contribution to the eurasian session , because he outlined his views on why distant language comparisons are very difficult because of the progressive loss of data , yet he is not in the business of criticizing people who attempt these . he is in the business of himself contributing to a deepening of both linguistic and mythological comparisons as much as he can in areas which are still to a great extent uncharted . johanna nichols also provoked much thought with her methods , and ways of integrating more information on peripheries vs . centers of innovation and residue of repeated waves of innovation visible even at the peripheries , as a pattern to look for in projecting a homeland backwards in time . i am somewhat skeptical about very distant language comparisons which involve only identities of sound correspondence , precisely because it is so easy for this approach to select a very old but still relatively more recent layer of borrowings ( more recent than the node on the family tree we may be struggling to find a way to reach ) . as greenberg pointed out , an increase in the number of conditioning contexts over time , once it approaches the number of lexical items available for comparison , leads to the result that there are virtually no recurrences of exactly the same sound correspondences . please see a separate message on how we can sharpen our tools to deal with this , titled " typology of historical change " . this means that i start out somewhat skeptical about alan bomhard 's nostratic and similar comparisons , precisely because he uses only or preferentially sound correspondences of identity . but that may be my personal bias , and i may end up granting that such a strictness of sound correspondences can actually work over great time depths . i cannot presume to know . there was one session i did not attend but report here from the abstract , in which researchers reported results of mitochondrial dna studies of the various native american populations . as expected , eskimo and athabaskan were separable ( one variety each ? ) . the remainder of native american populations shared four varieties of mitochondrial dna , either without subgrouping , or perhaps in two major subgroups . bob rankin did attend and says that the authors in their presentation had come down on the side of two major subgroups . population genetics need not match language directly , but the data is still at least interesting and obliquely relevant . . . lloyd anderson

ham in work following up the work of laitman , lieberman et al on reconstruction of what vocal tracts of hominids and early humans must have been like , i believe some mechanical simulators of the output of these were made . i would be interested in details of this , but more in whether anyone has tried to do a computer simulation of the phonetic range of vocal tracts that differ from those of modern humans e . g . in having a higher larynx . on a related question , i saw a letter to scientific american a year or so ago saying some of the origins of language work was based on a fallacy : that mammals other than humans can breathe and swallow at the same time . > from my reading this does seem to underly some of the major work , so i 'd like to have some confirmation that it is wrong or someone to point me to where the debate is going on , if there is a debate . from my point of view ( ignorance of anatomy / physiology and biological anthropology ) it would seem to be a question that could be fairly easily resolved empirically . patrick mcconvell , anthropology , northrn territory university , po box 40146 , nt 0811 , australia
ham linguist list subscribers may have been puzzled on 7th february by a posting in which a publisher included a notice of a new book , but omitted its title and other relevant details . the book was my educating eve . since there were some omissions in the original posting , i would like to briefly say what was left out . educating eve , subtitled " the ' language instinct ' debate " , 160 pp . , hardback , isbn 0304339083 , is available in the usa from cassell / books international , herndon va , tel . 1-800 - 561-7704 or 703 661 1501 ; and in the uk from cassell of london , + 44 171 420 5555 . it is a reply to steven pinker 's widely-read 1994 book the language instinct . pinker 's book argued that detailed knowledge of language is biologically innate in human beings . my educating eve examines all of pinker 's arguments , as well as the older arguments on which pinker relies . i show that each strand of argument either is logically fallacious , or is based on false premisses ( or , sometimes , both at once ) . there is no " language instinct " . the language use discussion list , based at temple university , has carried a contribution ( by donald carroll , not previously known to me ) which commented that educating eve " has got to be the definitive response to pinker 's book and chomskyan nativism in general . . . a wonderful book " . i hope my publisher 's internet - naivety will not prevent educating eve being read . geoffrey sampson school of cognitive & computing sciences university of sussex falmer , brighton bn1 9qh , gb e-mail geoffs @ cogs . susx . ac . uk tel . + 44 1273 678525 fax + 44 1273 671320 web site http : / / www . grs . u-net . com - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [ moderators ' note : since mistakes were made in the original posting , linguist is reposting the full text of the announcement below . ] title : educating eve author : geoffrey sampson author affiliation : lecturer at the school of computer science and artificial intelligence at the university of sussex , uk publisher : cassell field : linguistics , format : hardback price # 45 . 00 / $ 67 . 95 order details : uk and rest of world please call + 44 1202 665432 usa : please contact books international , po box 605 , herndon , virginia 20172-0605 on tel 703 661 1589 , fax 703 661 1501 synopsis of the book : are we creatures who learn new things ? or does human mental development consist of awakening instinctive structures of thought ? a view has gained ground - powerfully advocated , for example , by steven pinker 's book the language instinct - that language in much of its detail is hard-wired in our genes . others add that this also holds true for much of the specific knowledge and understanding expressed in language . when the first human eve evoleved from pre-human apes ( it is claimed ) , her biological inheritance comprised not just a distinctive anatomy but a rich structure of cognition . despite the impressive roll of converts which these ideas have gained , there is no good reason to believe them . the arguments of pinker and others depend on earlier and more technical contributions , by writers such as noam chomsky . many readers take these foundations on trust , not realizing how weak they are . this book examines the various arguments for instinctive knowledge , and finds that each one rests on false premises or embodies a logical fallacy . a different picture of learning is suggested by karl popper 's account of knowledge growing through ' conjectures and refutations ' . the facts of human language are best explained by taking language acquisition to be a case of popperian learning . eve was not born a know-all . she was born knowing nothing , but able to learn anything . that is why we can find ways to think and talk about a world that goes on changing today .

" four extra years in school and an extra $ 20 , 000 in student loans on top of the first $ 18 , 000 , what will i do if the same happens to me ? " i began to doubt my patience for the long term investment in schooling , and decided enough was enough , " why can't i make real money now instead of waiting to graduate with no guarantee of a lucrative return for all of my efforts ! " i am writing to share my experience with other hopeful students out there , as well as anyone looking for an opportunity to take their financial situation into their own hands . i hope you will consider this opportunity seriously and that this will change your life forever ! . , financially ! ! ! and once you get started it takes so little of your time . in mid october 97 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . i took this as a sign ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , it made perfect sense . here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start ( about as much as it costs for a pizza ! ) , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided " i have nothing to lose " . initially i sent 15 , 000 emails , ( without any costs to me ) only a couple of hours of my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the time to fulfil my orders . there is a vast on-line market available to everyone who owns a computer . following the advice of the person from whom i received this letter , i am telling you like it is , and i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself i would not " rip-off " anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! after you receive the reports they should explain everything to you . you may have some general questions , however , and after i send you report # 1 , please feel free to contact me and i will give you any advice you need . in one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by mid november , i had received 40 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program you will see that " you must receive 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks if you don ' t send out more programs until you do !

" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal " . well , i had 174 orders for report # 2 , 74 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by january 20th , of my emailing of 15 , 000 , i received $ 54 , 000 with more coming in ever day . the great thing about this program is you can begin the process over and over again without any limit on potential income ! i paid off all my student loans , and together with everything i have learned in school , i am now saving in order to open up my own business related to my field as soon as i graduate . please take time to read the attached program . it will change your life forever ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place on the list . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders of report # 1 and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry , it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . to my fellow graduate students out there , good luck to you and i sympathise . and to all other persons in financial trouble consider this letter a sign and please take advantage of this opportunity . you won ' t be disappointed ! sincerely , anne bowman the following testimonial was at the bottom of this letter but it was too good to leave down there so i moved it up here . it is exactly how i felt at first and feel now .

" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to = 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report = # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , " you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . " well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in = every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! " threw it away " " i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . " dawn w . , evansville , in " no free lunch " " my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . ' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . " alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , " the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . " the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to " move up " or " get rich " , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with " no risk " and " just a little bit of effort . " you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! " think about it " before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money !

ham a few weeks ago i posted a query about the orthographic marking of vowel length , with special reference to korean . i received many very interesting replies , both on korean and on the general question , which i will summarise below - the whole topic raises some issues that people might like to comment further on . first though - thanks to everyone who took the trouble to send me information . it was my first linglist query and i ' m delighted with the way it works ! it would have taken me ages to assemble all these examples from library research . at first i was surprised to get a lot of replies suggesting as examples of languages that dont mark vowel length , english , german and so on . then i realised i should have been clearer in my original request . a . fox put the problem well with his question : ' your query about writing and vowel length is slightly odd , since it implies that in most languages with contrastive vowel-length the writing system represents it . but this depends on what you mean by ' representing ' vowel-length ; in the sense of having an explicit and consistent marker of length , such as a double letter , a diacritic or other length mark , this is not very common , at least in languages with which i am familiar . but length can be implicitly marked in a variety of ways , and therefore discoverable from the spelling for anyone ( such as the literate native speaker ) who knows the system . ' i 'd intended to include all of these things as ways of ' representing ' vowel length ; definitely not only cases where vowel length is represented as a feature in its own right by a macron , double symbol etc . so what i wanted was examples of languages with an extensive system of minimal pairs differentiated wholly or mainly by vowel length which have identical orthographic representations of the members of the pairs . this is the situation in korean , for quite a largish set of words of both one and two syllables . it 's definitely not the situation in english , german , canadian french , danish etc . i dont think its the situation in latin either , though i might be wrong , and would be glad of correction . here and in quite a few of the other languages that were suggested to me , vowel length is predictable from some other aspect of the word ( including its lexical identity ) so you dont actually get many or any minimal pairs differentiated only by length . right ? the same would appear to be the case for hausa ; and possibly for the other estonian vowel length contrast ? my estonian is a bit rusty , but would i be right in guessing that the full three way contrast is fairly limited ? however , several of the pacific languages that were mentioned to me do seem to fit the bill : tokelauan , samoan , maori , fijian and the ponapeic languages are all candidates for having what i would call a genuine length contrast ( although it seems that in maori at any rate the system of contrasts is quite limited ) , which is at least sometimes not shown in the orthography . so , it seems , does the australian language bardi , and its orthography doesnt show it . . the thing i found very interesting was the number of people who sent anecdotal evidence about how native speakers of these languages feel about marking vowel length . their writing systems are all of course relatively recent introductions based on the roman alphabet , and there are plenty of ways they could show vowel length . but they dont always use this potential it seems . apparently the speakers of ponapeic languages use length marking inconsistently , so do fijian speakers , maori speakers find it ' unnatural ' and dont like using it , tokelauan teachers have decided not to teach it , and in samoa use of a length marker is banned ! there seems to be something worth exploring here . the obvious hypothesis is that though the words are differentiated phonetically by length , this is not the distinction that is most salient to the native speakers . the next obvious hypothesis is that it is some kind of lexical distinction , similar to that of english ' good ' vs ' food ' , ' boot ' vs 's oot ' , ' look ' vs ' loop ' etc that is perfectly simple for native speakers and horrible for learners . ( which could also explain why gaelic has taken the opposite trend and started marking vowel length where it never used to , since it is used so much nowadays by less than fully native speakers . . . ) . thoughts on these hypotheses would be gratefully received . but back to korean . . . this still seems like a very unusual situation to me . it seems likely and indeed it was suggested by some of the korean respondents that the original hangul did have a length marker , but i have found no evidence for this in my research on hangul . ( that 's why i posted the orginal query , and i ve just had another look at ledyard 's thesis on the topic . ) maybe i just need to do more careful research : pointers on this also gratefully received . a couple of points of clarification : the distinction between the monosyllabic vowel length ' minimal pairs ' does seem to be dying out ( though it is the fact that it previously existed but was not marked in the writing system at that time that i find odd ; could it be that the lack of orthographic representation contributes to its demise ? ? ) . but there is a clear distinction in the sound of the two syllable pairs . to my ears these distinction seems to be much more one of pitch accent than of length . and : when i said that native speakers dont easily identify vowel length , i didnt mean that they say ' my language doesnt have a vowel length distinction ' - which would indeed be a statement to be cautious of ! i meant they dont know which word is supposed to have the long vowel and which the short . this is consistent with information sent by native speakers that it is something taught in schools as a prescriptive rule well for anyone who has read this far , let me reward you by sharing with you this response from fran karttunen ( i hope she doesnt mind ) . i dont know exactly how to interpret it with respect to my questions above , but i ' m sure there 's something in it for all of us ! ' both the maya and the nahua ( speakers of unrelated mesoamerican languages ) had achieved a partially-syllabic approach to writing before the arrival of europeans in the first quarter of the 16th century . from what we can tell of their writing , both made some use of rhebus principles in which a drawing of thing , the name of which was similar rather than identical , was used to suggest the intended word / syllable . for instance , a drawing of a a bare bottom ( tzin-tli " buttocks " ) was used for the honorific suffix - tzin . likewise a drawing of a banner , pan-tli was used for locative - pan . these two examples are suffixes , but there are similar cases for initial syllables of nahuatl noun stems , for instance . vowel length , at least for nahuatl , is not taken into account in these cases . the honorific suffix today has the reflex of a long vowel in most modern dialects of nahuatl , making it homophonous with the stem of " buttocks " , but attestation from the sixteenth century consistently show them to contrast in vowel length ( short for the honorific , long for " buttocks " ) . same for " banner " ( long vowel ) versus the locative ( short ) .

ham call for papers ijcai-95 workshop on context in natural language processing august 19 , 20 , or 21 , 1995 montreal , canada correct interpretation of natural language utterances and texts requires linguistic and non-linguistic context . the goal of this workshop is to investigate the nature of context in natural language , its role in natural language processing , and shed some light on this largely unexplored area of great theoretical and practical importance . dialogue and text processing are two application domains where the lack of good theories of context impedes significant progress in applying and developing new technologies . as speech technology matures , it becomes technically feasible to build dialogue systems . however , understanding dialogues , and especially multimodal dialogues , is not possible without some account of the role of context . similarly , with today 's text processing technology it is feasible to automatically create knowledge bases from fairly unconstrained texts such as newspaper archives . ignoring context in such texts , however , results in knowledge bases that are not only very incomplete , but also dramatically different from knowledge bases created by humans , based on the same texts . we invite papers from researchers active in the fields of natural language processing , knowledge representation , and other related areas addressing theoretical aspects of context and their implications for designing practical nlp systems . we are interested in reports on implemented nlp systems utilizing contextual information . we are also interested in knowledge representation systems , inference methods , and algorithms that would allow one to computationally handle specific aspects of context . agenda : our workshop will provide answers and insights into how to go about answering a number of questions , including the following : i : role of context in natural language what is context ? what is " context of the previous utterance / sentence " " context of the dialog-so - far / text-so - far " and what is the relationship between them ? how many different contexts are there ? what makes two contexts different ? what is the relationship between formalization of context and natural language ideas of context ? what is the status of context in a formal representation aiming at truthfully capturing all the characteristics of natural language ? is context an inherent characteristic of natural language that ultimately decides the formal power of natural language ? is natural language minus context a less powerful formal language ? does representing context and truthfully capturing characteristics of natural language require new knowledge representation or automated reasoning systems ? what is the relationship between context , and the semantics and pragmatics of natural language ? is context different from possible worlds and situations ? what is the relationship between domain ontologies and contexts ? ii : context-dependent interpretation of natural language in which way does context affect interpretation of natural language utterances and texts ? which aspects of context or which contexts result in refined , more general , and different interpretations of natural language ? which aspects of context are explicit and which are implicit in natural language utterances and texts ? which phenomena and inferences observed in natural language are context-independent and which ones always depend on context ? iii : computability does handling context increase or decrease computational complexity of natural language processing ? how to automatically identify context-provided constraints resulting in conveying and understanding additional or different aspects of information ? how to represent those extra constraints provided by context and how to automatically compute context-dependent interpretation of natural language ? should the final interpretation of natural language be decontextualized when stored in a knowledge base ? how can information obtained in one context be utilized in another , possibly unanticipated context ? workshop format : we will hold four sessions : i : role of context in natural language ii : context -

ham i am organizing a combination colloquium and working seminar which is planned to take place in oulu finland just after the jyvaskyla 8th internat ' l fenno - ugric congress ( fu8 runs thru 15 august ' 95 ) . entitled " the peopling ( s ) of the north , " this gathering is intended to convoke roughly 30-40 scholars to discuss the archaeological , bioanthropological , ethnographic ( including comparative myth / religion / folkways etc ) , and * linguistic * data , concepts , and methods as these all inter-relate and bear on the question of the development of the sundry peoples of scandinavia , fenno - karelia , northwest russia , and the northern circum - urals . this gathering is to aid idea exchange among specialists in the domains pertinent to reconstruction of the ( pre ) historical events and processes involved in the peopling ( s ) of this region . those in each speciality will be required to speak to their ignorances , i . e . , to come prepared to discuss * not * what they already know , but to point out what they really would * like * to know from those in the other specialities . the aim is to avoid the presentation of set-pieces and to foment exploration of the many possible ways in which each of the various ( pre ) historical disciplines can feed from the others . my collaborators in this venture ( norbert strade , historically and archaeologically inclined linguist , in aarhus dk ; milton nunez , ethnologically and geographically inclined archaeologist in oulu ) and i have a long list of probable participants . however , we feel that there is a distinct under - representation as regards indo - europeanist linguistics . those i - eists of our acquaintance who are interested in pre - i - e substrate effects in northern europe , possible early i - e and f - u interactions in the north ( or elsewhere ) , and other intriguing themes of relevance to our plans , cannot make it to oulu in august . thus i am sending this request . if anyone is interested , please contact me . nb - the time frame for us begins with the repopulation of the north as the last ice age retreated , hence less than 10 , 000bp . all discussion of i - e ( = ) uralic interactions and / or relations grounded in posits of macro-families &c with roots in ` deep time ' therefore falls outside the scope of our plans . i hope to hear from you . ken jacobs voice : ( 514 ) 343-6490 [ office ] assoc . prof .

ham in response to poser , nichols does on p . 6 of her book claim that there is no way for the comparative method to distinguish between nostratic and " a much larger grouping of most lineages of the old world and new world " , that is , as she herself says , between hypothetical groupings of around c . 12000 and c . 40000 years ago , and she does say that this " because the cut-off point is so shallow " , the cut-off point being the ceiling of 6000-10000 years which she imposes ( wihout any basis , as noted in my earlier messages ) on the comparative method . since this amounts to a rejection of the nostratic hypothesis ( not as false perhaps but as unverifiable / unfalsifiable , i guess ) , this means that i am right and poser is wrong about whether there have been people who have rejected particular theories of linguistic relationship on the basis of this mythical ceiling idea . in response to teeter : i think ( and i hope karl will endorse this ) that our disagreements are really quite minor , but they are real as far as they go . for example , while karl is obviously 100 % right about meillet 's position in the scientia article ( where meillet says that lexical comparisons can never prove a relationship , and only morphological ones can ) , in his 1925 book meillet repeatedly states that you can establish a linguistic relationship purely on the basis of lexical correspondences , makes the same point that i have been making over and over again here on linguist that for some language families this is the only way of showing relationship since they lack morphology , and even makes the same point that i did about how certain things can only be done once you have established , at least tentatively , that the languages you are dealing with are related . as a matter of fact , he even shows how you could demonstrate the relatedness of the romance languages purely on the basis of a lexical comparison , using the numerals 1-10 , and then shows how you could do that for the older indo - european languages too ( although there he begins to slip in a little morphology ) . i would also like to add that i think it is a serious mistake to pretend that there are no models for comparative linguistics besides indo - european , because it is so utterly atypical of the language families of the world . there are plenty of equally well established families , several of which are older in the only sense that matters , that is , not in years before the present but in years before the earliest written records and many of which are more useful models for those working on families not yet established ( afroasiatic , austronesian , austroasiatic , uto - aztecan , altaic , etc . ) . which is not to say that there is anything wrong with knowing as much as possible about ie , but rather that there is much wrong with knowing naught but indo - european . i am not sure but i think that this is what eric hamp had in mind in a recent paper in the davis / iverson volume when he complained about how the teaching of historical linguistics is hampered by textbooks which largely draw their material from ie ( or indeed from some favored parts of it , such as romance ) . and i am happy to have sally thomason point out that morphological elements can be borrowed . meillet we must remember was greatly troubled by the possibility of such a thing and of the existence of mixed languages . he tried to debunk every examples around , and thought ( wrongly i think ) that if such languages exist , then they cannot be handled by the comparative method . the fact that such languages do exist ( e . g . , mitchif ) and yet pose no problem ( so that we have no trouble tracing certain parts of mitchif to french and others to cree ) means that meillet was worried for naught . but it also means that language classification on the basis of morphology is no more infallibible than that on the basis oif lexical material . you work with what you have available , which in some cases may be largely morphology and only a few obvious lexical parallels ( that 's how afro - asiatic was first established ) , morphology and lexicon ( indo - european ) , lexicon and a single morphological parallel ( algic , as victor golla reminded me just the other day ) , lexicon only ( vietnames and the rest of mon - khmer ) , and so on and so forth .

ham typology of historical change this note tries to make explicit what i take for granted , and have discussed with others on occasion , but which perhaps needs a more explicit statement . one of the most fruitful avenues of research in distant language comparison , i believe , is the growth of the field i call typology of historical change . under this rubric i include for example the work of johanna nichols ( whether or not i agree with any data , findings or particulars of method , is not relevant to my point ; i still think it helps our thinking along ) . i also include , and this is a challenge i want to issue , the * * * mode of discourse * * * in which mr . vovin asked recently for help in finding typological parallels to a hypothesis he was interested in that a phrase meaning " water falls " could fossilize ( ? ) into a basic word for " rain " . in response to his query , he got back some positive answers , examples which people claimed fit this description . as a method of reasoning , this is what we need more of . that is , more accumulations of attested examples of particular changes , to educate our intuitions of what we naively think are " possible " semantic shifts by ever more experience with what actual semantic shifts are known or suspected . it will help us to improve our methods of guestimating possible language relationships , because it will at least say that a given hypothesized semantic shift is frequently attested , so it is not straining to compare lexical items whose meanings differ in such and such a way . whereas by contrast another hypothesized semantic shift is not firmly attested . so such an unattested semantic shift should probably not be used in those distant language comparisons which are themselves the most difficult to do , because over large time spans the number of context-sensitive conditioning environments is as great as the number of lexical items available to compare , and thus there are few or no * * * recurring * * * sound correspondences . in other words , as we move towards deeper comparisons , we must more and more rely on ways of measuring " distance " of semantic shift and " distance " of phonological change , rather than measuring repeating sound correspondences and semantic identities . we do not yet have our tools for doing this very well sharpened , but we can proceed gradually to sharpen them . a study of the known attested cases is the best start . in other words , if someone really wants to see how our methods fare with gradually more distant language comparisons , and to see how some new methods may fare , they should tabulate , for all known language relationships , ( a ) the proportion of sound-correspondence repetition in the comparable vocabulary ( and what " comparable " means is itself a variable , not exclusively defined by ( b ) and ( c ) ) ( b ) the " semantic distance " along attested paths of semantic change of lexical items being compared . where multiple such shifts have been attested , the estimated " distance " counts as closer , smaller . where few such shifts have been attested , the estimated " distance " counts as greater . we of course do not have enough such information in database form to use at present , but whatever we do have can be used provisionally , as explained in ( d ) ( c ) the " phonetic distance " along attested paths of phonetic change of lexical items being compared . there is relatively more of this knowledge available than for phonological change . ( d ) exploring how the three measures above vary as we go to greater time depths . that is , using first the more assured cases , then the less assured ones , how does a weighted average of " closeness " of compared lexical items vary as we go to increasing time depths ? how does the proportion of regular and often recurring sound correspondences to unique or rarely recurring sound correspondences vary as we go to increasing time depths ? it is the development of the tools in ( b , c ) which will most advance our abilities to compare at greater time depths , improve our methods . i will be very grateful to anyone who points me to studies which approximate to parts of the program outlined just above . " the comparative method " currently does not have the benefit of fully developed tools of this kind . to that degree , the current comparative methods can be considered less rigorous than they ought to be , and for that reason not as powerful at distant language comparisons as they will sometime come to be . a future comparative method can use these tools more and more precisely . the real challenge today to existing comparativists is to avoid artificially fossilizing the term " the comparative method " , to avoid treating its methods as fixed and not subject to improvement and supplementing with newer and more powerful methods , as are the methods in any other science . it would be healthy if the word " the " were dropped from the term and it were made a mass or plural term " comparative methods " . that implies no lessening of rigor . indeed , as i have been at pains to point out above , i firmly believe some of the limitations of the present state of comparative methods result from a * * * lack of rigor * * * in the area of the typology of possible changes ( phonetic , semantic , grammatical ) . work discussed by bill croft in the topic of syntactic reconstruction and typology is certainly relevant to the concerns raised here . i think we are seeing the beginnings of a new paradigm in the focus on paths of change in language , and comparative-historical linguists will be left behind if they do not add these techniques to their box of tools ( while keeping all the good techniques they already have ) . lloyd anderson

spam * * * this is not spam ! * * * my name is matthew . i make a habit of deleting mail i have not yet read , as i ' m sure you do also . please read this one though , you might find this interesting . i recently lost my high paying job from a major computer corporation due to their loss of a major contract . they messed up , but that whole dep ' t of 15 people including myself are hung out to dry . corporate america at it 's finest . i have not had luck yet finding another job , as my skills were very specific to that company and not really worth anything to another company . during the time i worked there , i also bought and sold real estate like those guys on tv . ( yes , you can do that and make it work for you too ) the key is i made it work . i was fairly successful until the " nightmare on pleasant st . " as my friends and i call it . . . i lost most of my money in that one bad deal and i was no longer financially secure and i relied heavily on my income from my former job . as you ' ve already heard , i lost that too and i started to look for other things i could make money to help me get back on my feet . so , i started to read all of the junk that people have mailed to me . let me tell you , i can't believe some of the things out there . . . what a waste of time . until i saw this . hold on . i know you are ( like i was ) ready to stop reading right here . i implore you not to . i ( like you ) am not some non-educated fool . i have made much money for myself in real estate , which is not an easy business . i am a rather competent business man . at least finish reading this until the end . * * better still : print this letter and read it in comfort over , and over here is what i saw . . . * i only needed $ 20 extra dollars to try this * this is making money for people who at least tried a little , so why not me too ? in desparation , i sent the four 5 dollar bills and got the reports . as i always have , i made this work for me too . i took much time and effort to learn about e-mail ( which is a great and free tool ! ! ) and how to send lots of it . now , 19 days after my first mailing of this , i have received roughly 8 , 450 responses . ( trust me , when my fiance ` saw 8 , 450 5 dollar bills on the kitchen table , she no longer laughed at me for trying this ) i wrote a report of my own showing step by step how to do the same which i will give to you for free as a helping hand so we can all continue this success . i will show you every step of cutting , pasting , editing this letter to include your name and address , etc . here is my special offer to help you . . . . as long as my address , basquiat at the evanston po box is on the list below i will send the step-by - step instructions and 100 , 000 e-mail addresses to anyone who orders any report from me . it took some time and expense to put this list together so all i ask is that you add another $ 5 for handling the addresses . the instructions for e _ mailing are free . they will come to you in a . txt format ( which i will teach you how to use in the instructions i ' ve put together ) and less than 2 % will be duplicates . you will get the list of addresses with your report . the first 160 people who order a report from me will receive a different set of addresses . this is my gift to you to help you get started . . . . i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money ! ) , you will make at least as much money as i am . you do n't need to be a whiz at the computer , but i ' ll bet you already are . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you ' re on your way to the bank . take the time to read this so you ' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you !

ham many readers of linguist ( and of language ) are , as the open letter indicates , interested in methodological issues that come up in efforts to establish very distant linguistic relationships like nostratic . although it 's true that language has published no review of illich - svitych 's books - - the scholar who agreed to review them has not yet submitted the promised review - - research in the same tradition has been reviewed in the journal : see bernard comrie 's review of starostin 's book on altaic and japanese in language 69 : 828-832 ( 1993 ) . the methodological issues involved in the altaic & japanese case are the same as the issues involved in the nostratic case , so i ' m puzzled by the open-letter signers ' apparent belief that the russian approach to these issues has received no attention in language . sarah thomason editor , language

ham the ongoing discussions about the comparative method do not seem to be getting anywhere on achieving real consensus in greenberg and anti - greenberg camps on the question of what would could as valid evidence that certain language families are related at a large time depth . i wonder if it would not be a good idea to hear something - - from the defenders of wide-ranging and large-time - depth comparison , preferably - - concerning what would count as evidence against a genetic relationship ? as a concrete example , take the fact , recently cited by poser , that all the muskogean evidence in greenberg 's book has been found to be tainted by data errors ( geoffrey d . kimball , a critique of muskogean , " gulf " , and yukian material in _ language in the americas _ , ijal 58 ( 1992 ) , 447-501 ) . i can imagine how one might want to maintain that even this total collapse of the case on muskogean merely puts us back in a state of being neutral , a priori , on whether muskogean languages are related to other amerindian languages , or to nostratic for that matter . anti - greenberg amerindianists are perfectly prepared to agree that the amerind languages might have descended from a common source now lost . that 's neutrality . but suppose we move from that neutrality to the position that we will assume as a default that muskogean is amerind , and so are all the languages of south america , and indeed , that amerind is related to sino - tibetan and both to indo - european and thus nostratic and all of the above to khoisan . . . let us assume for the sake of argument that the world 's languages are all genetically related ; but let us take this to be an empirical assumption - - not just a willingness to reject the closet racism that poser says ruhlen once alleged in his critics , or a yearning to find universal brotherhood , but an assumption against which evidence can in principle count . now , what sort of linguistic evidence would count , for greenberg and ruhlen and illich - svitych , as disproving the inclusion of muskogean or any other family in in the conjectural ( though tentatively assumed ) proto - gaeic ? that is , what sort of data pattern or configuration of phonological and grammatical properties could suffice to make the macrocomparativists throw in the towel and go outside to meet the press and concede defeat ? there ought to be some imaginable scenario that would end up with ruhlen telling a group of reporters from the stanford daily and american scientist and other supermarket tabloids , " well , we thought we could sustain the whole proto - gaeic thing , but that set of paradigms on haida has us beat ; we ' ve had to concede the haida case ; according to our tests , haida is unrelated to the other human languages . " ( much scope for new press attention here : " haida indians are aliens from space , top expert admits . " ) but what sort of scenario would it have to be , to get the greenberg camp to admit that it was in grave trouble on some relatedness claim ? to be fair , orthodox comparativists might well say that if you put it like this , no answer should be expected . one can argue that a certain methodology applied to a certain set of data yield no evidence for relatedness between burushaski and bushman , but not that it refutes such a relatedness . a positivist view of historical linguistics would see it as maintaining hypotheses about verifiable relatednesses in a very particular form : when i say that german " pfennig " comes from an earlier germanic form with initial " p " that will be seen in languages like english with no history of a high german sound shift , i am counted as having been supported by the observation that english speakers say " penny " ; if the form turned out to be " twenny " i would be in trouble ; given german " pfund " i am committed to something like " pund " in english , and ( given the great english vowel shift ) the discovery of " pound " is more good news for me ; and so on . the predictions i am making are about an indefinitely extensible set of pairs ( ger : pfxxx , eng : pxxx ) . now , the falsity of one of these could conceivably taken to refute brittle forms of the hypothesis that english cognates of german pf-words always begin with p - , but it is n't nearly enough to be counterevidence to the whole english / german relatedness claim , of course . that claim would not be given up unless there was a complete collapse of all the evidence : if " pound " was established textually to have been a coinage by a novelist who had never heard german , if " penny " was shown to be borrowed from italian " penne " during a period when pasta had been used for small change , and then all the other sound correspondences started collapsing as well . i ' m asking this : if the 100 % collapse of greenberg 's muskogean evidence , as alleged by kimball , does not count as a complete collapse of the case that muskogean is included in amerind ( hence , a fortiori , of the case that it is in proto - gaeic ) , then i think i need some help in understanding what could be evidence against that inclusion . there had better be something . + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - + | g e o f f r e y k . p u l l u m * pullum @ cats . ucsc . edu | | stevenson college , university of california , santa cruz , california 95064 | | ( 408 ) 459-4705 * messages ( 408 ) 459-2555 / 2905 * fax ( 408 ) 459-3334 | + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +

ham two quick off-the - cuff responses to messages herein : to geoff pullum , asking what would count as evidence against amerind ( and , presumably , nostratic ) . i can't imagine ; that is just the advantage those folks have . suppose somebody claims , " there is a god " . similarly i know no way to disprove the tower of babel story . genetic relationship is a positive fact ; and you gotta accentuate the positive ; languages are or they are not genetically related ; do n't mess with mister in-between . note to alexis , who keeps talking about " morphological evidence " where i use the term " grammar " . alexis 's usage comes from his quoting meillet - - for meillet the word " morphologie " means essentially what we now call grammar , which includes syntax and phonology , and we know more about it than he did ( thanks to chomsky ) . among other things , we know that if proto - nostratic is a language , it has a grammar . merry xmas , karl

ham while i really like most of what scott delancey had to say about syntactic reconstruction usually being based on clues buried in the morphology ( or morphophonology ) , i do n't think this is always the case . there is a rather famous example involving a rule of ancient greek and one variety of old iranian ( the languages of the gatha 's , i seem to recall ) , whereby a neuter pl . subject triggers sg . agreement on a verb , a pattern which is often reconstructed for the proto-language because , as i understand it , of its apparent oddity . this reconstruction is not logically dependent , i do n't believe , on the identity of the actual morphemes marking gender , number , and person in these languages . i would think that there are many such quirks of syntax which could be the basis of a reconstruction . e . g . , polish and several other indo - european languages show traces of a pattern whereby an np referring to a group composed of males and females is grammatically neuter . i have been playing around with the idea of trying to reconstruct this as an old pattern which would be quite independent of the particular number morphemes involved ( b . t . w . , if anyone knows of any literature on this phenomenon , i would be grateful for any references and will post them in summary form ) . another example ( which is not so interesting , because we happen to know the history ) : russian does various complicated things with the case / number endings of the nouns and adjectives when combined with numerals . thus , in the nominative case , ' these adj n ' and ' two adj n ' show different adj and noun forms in russian , where in the presence of a numeral from 2 to 4 the adj has to be in what looks the gen . pl . form ( unless it is feminine , when either the gen . pl . or the gen . sg . is possible ) and the noun in what looks like the gen . sg . form ( except for one or two nouns which seem to take a special form differing in stress placement from the gen . sg . ) . closely related polish , on the other hand , does nothing special in this case ( though both languages do other weird things with numerals above 4 , which need not concern us ) . i wonder if we would not be able to conclude from such behavior that the ancestor of these languages had a distinct paucal number ( 2 - 4 being paucal ) category , which then merged with the plural in polish , but stayed distinct in russian ( with the further hypothesis that some of the paucal endings must have looked like the genitive sg . ones ) . and an even further hypothesis might be that the paucal was originally dual , since paucal is a very unusual category to have . of course , we know that this is what happened , but i wonder if we could not have reconstructed it even if had not known . so , provided the syntactic patterns are distinctive ( e . g . , weird ) enough , purely syntactic comparative reconstruction should be possible ( and i bet that we could even find some more examples of it in the literature besides the greek - iranian one cited above ) . the problem only seems impossible when we consider patterns which are quite prosaic ( and where the number of possibilities is small ) , like the so-called basic word order that has been talked about so much in this discussion . even there , i think , that if we looked at the detailed facts of word order ( not just ov , vo , and the like ) in a group of languages , we might be able to reconstruct the proto - system of word order with some degree of confidence . and even the basic order might be reconstructable enough if we have enough languages with enough diversity and ( geographical ) dispersion between them . the fact that classical latin was often verb-final , while all the romance languages are verb-middle or verb-initial , does not seem to be a very important counterexample , because ( a ) vernacular latin may well have been much more verb - middle than the literary and it is only the former that is relevant , ( b ) the romance languages do not exhibit very much diversity or dispersion . for ex . , does it not seem clear that we can reconstruct ov for proto - turkic and proto - mongolic ? and vo for proto - polynesian ?

ham none of the examples mentioned in john cowan 's recent posting summarizing responses on this topic appears to involve a language that uses language solely to mark grammatical as opposed to lexical distinctions . which makes one wonder about stress . does anybody know of an example of a language in which stress is distinctive but only used to mark grammatical categories . i have some possible examples in mind but these need some further reflection , so if anybody has clear examples , i for one would be interested ( the examples i am thinking of , which i am not too sure about , would involve tongan and perhaps persian ) .

spam hello ! about two months ago i received it again and , because of the catchy subject line , i finally read it . afterwards , i thought , " ok , i give in , i ' m going to try this . i can certainly afford to invest $ 20 and , on the other hand , there 's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash . " i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! i was not prepared for the results . every day for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i ' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a house with 40 % down , we ' re going to venice , italy to celebrate ! i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money ! ) , you will make at least as much money as we did . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you ' re on your way to the bank . take the time to read this so you ' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you !

simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided " why not . " initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not " rip-off " anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that " you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! " my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , " you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal " well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , " the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . " the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to " move up " or " get rich " , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with " no risk " and " just a little bit of effort . " you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the " internet " by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! " think about it " before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and obtaining e-mail lists . instructions : we at erris mail order marketing businesses , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % everytime . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20-90 days . before you say " bull . . . " , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four ( 4 ) reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four ( 4 ) names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering it from . you will need all four ( 4 ) reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with your 's , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and the address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! ! ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the requested changes in the name list , save it as text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever e-mail program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and acquiring e-mail lists . step ( 4 ) e - mail a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , e-mail to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get e-mail addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four ( 4 ) reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports : * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 " how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales " order report # 1 from : kathy smith 5312 s . e . 30 ave ocala , fl 34480-7524 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 " major corporations and multi-level sales " order report # 2 from : micro info publishing inc . 2107 w . commonwealth ave . dept . 264 alhambra , ca 91803 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 " sources for the best mailing lists " order report # 3 from : som co . 2168 s . atlantic blvd . # 101 monterey park , ca 91754 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 " evaluating multi-level sales plans " order report # 4 from : kal inc . p . o . box 2433 glenview , il . 60025-2433 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion : i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20-90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say " no " than " yes " , and this the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that cost me pennies to produce and e-mail . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or a pyramid scam . at times you probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain lettters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four ( 4 ) financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy . best wishes with the program and good luck !

ham i am forwarding the following for posting at the request of robert rankin ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . unkans . edu ) . i do not subscribe to this list and have no wish to join the fray at present , but when my name is mentioned sometimes the file is forwarded to me via e-mail . thus the following : andy anderson cites me on three points in a series of recent postings . i have known andy upwards of 30 years and do not feel that he would in - tentionally misrepresent my views , but i also feel a couple of things need clarification . first , i am uncomfortable about being formally cited as a ( secondary ) source of information on lyle campbell 's paper from the boulder ( green - berg ) conference of ca . 1990 . if andy wishes to distribute an attack on the paper or its author in written form , he should first obtain an actual copy of it or , alternatively , await its publication . i guess i should n't have brought it up in our conversation at the ssila / aaa meetings . second , i am said to have reported that the geneticists who have studied the mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) of sundry native american and siberian peo - ples claim that there were / are " two subgroups within amerind ( aside from the eskimo and athabaskans ) . " this is not what i ( or the paper 's authors wallace , torroni and schurr , et al . ) said . the authors did not address themselves to the linguistic problems and most certainly did n't talk about " subgroups " . nor did i , since i do not regard the historicity of anything like " amerind " as even remotely established . the authors of the paper did posit at least four " migrations " . they do not discuss the most recent , eskomo - aleut , in their abstract , but i think they gave a time depth figure of about 6000 years bp ( before present ) for it orally - - do n't quote me . from their abstract : for what they call na - dene their figure is 7000-10000 years bp . then they say they have evidence for at least two " migrations " preceding that . one comes between 12000-15000 bp and the earliest between 26000-34000 bp . figures as high as 40000 bp were mentioned orally , as i recall . they did not attempt to correlate their figures with our knowledge of periods of glaciation or the periodic existence of the land bridge in beringia . i leave it to readers to decide what this portends for the amerind hypo - thesis or its proposed ( glotto ) chronology , but a warning is in order in any event . note that i have written " migration " in quotes above . this is not because i wish to pejorate the term ; it is because geneticists use it in a very special way . for them it has to do solely with the ap - pearance of specific genetic material in american populations . they then assume a common ancestor and calculate the number of millennia by positing a uniform mutation rate for mtdna . the material and theories they work with force this definition of migration on them . all this says nothing about the situation " on the ground . " in reality though , each of these genetic migrations can have included many distinct movements of people across beringia over a great many years - - perhaps centuries or even millennia . and they may have represented many ling - guistic groups . all that is required in order for entire clusters of migrations " on the ground " to get read as a single mtdna " migration " is a relatively homogeneous gene pool in eastern siberia over the particular time span when the " genetic mutation " occurred . the evidence does indeed suggest four genetic migrations , but it really says little or nothing about how many " real " migrations there were with - in each of the four clusters , nor does it say anything about linguistic diversity - - much less " subgroups of amerind . " we may wish it did , but it does n't . i do note with interest however the rough correlation between the geneticists ' oldest figures and the calculations of nichols ( 1990 in language 66 . 3 ) based on linguistic diversity in the western hemisphere . the more recent sets of mtdna dates fall within the esta - blished archaeological ballpark for clovis believers , although the earliest set certainly does not . one very short contribution of my own here - - mostly my wife 's actually , since she is a molecular geneticist and we talk about these things over breakfast . the yardstick used by mtdna geneticists in these cal - culations may not be appreciably better than that used in glottochrono - logy , i . e . , genetic mutation takes place at a rate which is only rela - tively constant . it can be speeded up by various singular events from cosmic ray bombardment to ingesting certain fungi infecting the grain from your cache pit . biologists try to allow for this sort of thing , but as you can see from the plus / minus dates for each cluster , we are not talking about something as precise as dendrochronology or even radiocarbon dating . the mtdna studies are very interesting but we must bear in mind their limitations and special use of the term " migration " . lastly , in an earlier posting andy mentions that i had examined green - berg 's notebooks and determined how he had mislabeled so much of his siouan data in lia . andy 's description of the way the notebooks are laid out is correct , but i have only actually seen xeroxes of the pages of siouan entries , not the notebooks themselves . i might add that the siouan entries in the notebook are hard by the iroquoian , caddoan , yuchi entries demonstrating once again that greenberg had decided on the final classification of these families when he laid out his notebook design and before the vocabularies from the languages were entered . my thanks to john koontz for posting this . sincerely , bob rankin ( university of kansas ) ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . ukans . edu )
ham ) 3 ) ) date : thu , 22 dec 1994 21 : 02 - 0500 ( est ) ) from : mike _ maxwell @ sil . org ) subject : evidence against greenberg ? ) ) perhaps the best evidence against greenberg 's hypothesis would be to show ) that his methods , when applied * in the same way * to randomly chosen samples ) of languages of the earth ( including some amerindian languages ) , group them ) in the same way and with the same degree of ( un ) certainty as those methods ) group amerindian languages ( less the athabaskan languages ) together . ( i ) put the stars around " in the same way " because one can easily distort ) someone else 's methods . ) as i understand it , some people have tried ) applying greenberg 's method to one amerindian language and one other ) language ( finnish was one such , i believe ) , but i have never heard of a ) large-scale comparison being done in this way . ( and i believe greenberg ) says his method is best used for mass comparison , not one-on - one . ) ) here we go again . some bean counter some day will tot up the number of times " greenberg " occurs here and will rate the corresponding work as " highly influential " . never mind . there is no difference between mass comparison and pair comparison . when you engage in mass comparison you carry out a large number of pair comparisons . the greater the number of comparisons , the more chances you have of finding cognates . . and chance resemblances . take two dice and roll them . how often will they show the same score ? take a bagful of them and empty it onto the floor . matches galore . but that does not matter . we ' ve had recently a long , long , exchange on the comparative method , in which alexis manaster ramer made a point - - which he seemed to believe as important - - that no language had been found to retain less than 86 % of some sample wordlist ( swadesh 's 100 ? does n't matter as you shall soon see ) per thousand years . the claim is false , but never mind , i ' ll grant it as true . i ' ll even grant you 90 % retention . america , they say , was populated 18 , 000 years ago . well , not so , evidence from brazil now seem to push it back to 50 , 000 bp . but i ' ll grant you 18 , 000 bp . and that everybody since the great crossing was careful not to be linguistically overly innovative , so that there exist at least two maximally distant languages which have retained 90 % of their vocabulary millennium in millenium out . today you could expect to see between them 0 . 9 ^ ( 18 * 2 ) = 0 . 0225 , i . e . 2 . 25 % words in common . on that famous 100 - item highly stable " basic " vocabulary . so that 's your proto - amerind reconstituted . now , of course , we have not taken chance resemblances into account . if you remember greenberg sci . am . article and his calculations , he estimates the probability of chance resemblances at 1 in 250 . but he forgets that he allows a bit of metathesis . in fact , if you read carefully ruhlen 's " on the origin of languages " complete anagramming , since he list irish " bligim " as cognate with his * malk ' a . there are six ways in which you can combine 3 consonants , so that is really one chance of resemblance in 42 ( 250 / 6 = a tad under 42 ) . using their figure , then , how many chance resemblances show you expect to find in a 100 - item wordlist ? 100 / 42 = 2 . 38 . bingo ! more than real cognates after 18 , 000 years with very conservative languages . now , * if * america was really populated 50 , 000 years ago we should see 0 . 9 ^ ( 50 * 2 ) = 0 . 002656 % of your 100 - item list preserved . that 's one word in 37 , 649 . so out of every pair of 100 - item lists you will find , on the average , 1 / 37649 * 100 = 0 . 0027 wrods in common . meaning that you can look forward to examining some 376 pairs before you find one single cognate . but thanks to mass comparison , you are sure to find it . only compare 50 seemingly * unrelated * languages ( because you want to pick maximally distant languages ) . that gives you 50 * ( 50 - 1 ) / 2 = 1225 pairwise comparisons . with a bit of luck , that will give 3 or 4 cognates , each attested by 2 or 3 languages . . . . and stacks of spurious resemblances , each attested by far many more languages than your true cognates . perhaps america was not populated 50 , 000 years ago . but australia was at least 40 , 000 bp . that does not prevent some from reconstructing proto - australian . and trying to link it to indo - european . enough fun with figures . why do n't you try to * simulate * a paltry 30 , 000 years worth of evolution of 30 languages each represented by 100 words , with a one-in - 250 ( see how generous i am ) chance of resemblances ?

" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to = 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report = # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , " you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . " well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in = every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! " threw it away " " i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . " dawn w . , evansville , in " no free lunch " " my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . ' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . " alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , " the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . " the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to " move up " or " get rich " , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with " no risk " and " just a little bit of effort . " you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! " think about it " before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say " bull " , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders !

ham re guido vanden wyngaerd ( 3-357 ) : i must break my longish silence caused by a few urgent jobs : > since nyman does n't seem to begin to understand > what the problem is here , let me expand on my question once more : we find > that speakers * observe * ( not violate ) the wh-island constraint ; we find > that they form yes-no questions by having recourse to hierarchical > structure rather than linear precedence , i . e . they unfailingly produce ( 1a ) > rather than ( 1b ) : > > ( 1 ) a is [ the man who is tall ] _ _ in the room ? > b is [ the man who _ _ tall ] is in the room ? i must admit my dull-wittedness . sorry about that ! i also agree that a real issue is involved here . > if speakers proceeded on the basis of inductive generalisation or analogy > or some such principle , one would expect a more or less random distribution > over ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) in the acquisition stage , quod non . why would a more or less random distribution over ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) be expectable in the acquisition stage , if speakers unfailingly - - and so , as the only pattern for children to base inductive generalizations on - - produce ( 1a ) ? > hence speakers > possess a certain knowledge or follow certian rules , and one would like to > know where they get this knowledge from . are you suggesting chomskyan " tacit " knowledge ? if so , then you might think that rules grow in people 's minds like biological organs . > the question now is : how can one tell if rules speakers > follow , such as the wh-island rule or the yes-no question formation rule , > are grules or lrules ? where does the conviction come from that speakers " follow " the wh-island rule ? this rule , as formulated and so named by a grammarian , is clearly a theoretical generalization ( grule ) . notice that the phenomenon here captured in insular terms is in principle amenable to a different theoretical formulation : e . g . , in dick hudson 's word grammar ( _ english _ word _ grammar _ . oxford 1990 ) , which is a dependency-based approach , ( 1b ) would be ruled out by the fact that it infringes the adjacency principle ( not to be confused with gb 's adjacency ) . while it is grammatically correct to say ( 2a ) is the man who is tall in the room ? , it would be grammatically incorrect ( and nonsensical ) to say ( 2b ) * is the man who tall is in the room ? in my terminology , ( 2a - b ) are technically rule-sentences which exemplify ( and witness for the existence ) of the corresponding norm of language ( lrule ) . it is typical of norms that they may be violated by mistake or by joke ( cf . alexis manaster ramer 's [ 3-371 ] posting on _ man _ the _ as a [ putatively ] possible np ) ; sometimes also by force , in order to bring home a theoretical point [ e . g . ( 1b ) above ] . lrules ( or norms-of - language qua institutional or cultural facts ) are typically learned or acquired by experience . but some norms are so deeply rooted in human nature that their violation is more or less unnatural and requires an extra effort . ( this is one of the basic tenets of stampean natural phonology , unless i ' m mistaken . ) for example , anyone standing on two hands ( instead of two legs ) in a cocktail party would certainly violate a norm of socially correct behaviour . in this case , the ' two-leg ' constraint is almost vacuously a norm , because it would be hard to violate it . in the same vein , the lrule of which ( 2a ) is an exemplification , is almost vacuously a norm , because only a linguistic professional could violate it by producing ( 2b ) . but it is a norm , nonetheless . > and what merit is there to making such a distinction > at all ? this distinction is ( meta ) descriptive of generative grammarians ' actual practice . martti nyman , dept of general linguistics , univ of helsinki , finland

ham final call for papers http : / / www . cs . iastate . edu / ~ icgi98 / icgi98 . html fourth international colloquium on grammatical inference ( icgi-98 ) program co - chairs : vasant honavar and giora slutzki iowa state university july 12-14 , 1998 iowa state university ames , iowa , usa . cosponsored by international institute of theoretical and applied physics iowa state university and in cooperation with american association for artificial intelligence ieee systems , man , and cybernetics society acl special interest group on natural language learning introduction grammatical inference , variously refered to as automata induction , grammar induction , and automatic language acquisition , refers to the process of learning of grammars and languages from data . machine learning of grammars finds a variety of applications in syntactic pattern recognition , adaptive intelligent agents , diagnosis , computational biology , systems modelling , prediction , natural language acquisition , data mining and knowledge discovery . traditionally , grammatical inference has been studied by researchers in several research communities including : information theory , formal languages , automata theory , language acquisition , computational linguistics , machine learning , pattern recognition , computational learning theory , neural networks , etc . perhaps one of the first attempts to bring together researchers working on grammatical inference for an interdisciplinary exchange of research results took place under the aegis of the first colloquium on grammatical inference held at the university of essex in united kingdom in april 1993 . this was followed by the ( second ) international colloquium on grammatical inference , held at alicante in spain , the proceedings of which were published by springer - verlag as volume 862 of the lectures notes in artificial intelligence , and the third international colloquium on grammatical inference , held at montpellier in france , the proceedings of which were published by springer - verlag as volume 1147 of the lecture notes in artificial intelligence . following the success of these events and the workshop on automata induction , grammatical inference , and language acquisition , held in conjunction with the international conference on machine learning at nashville in united states in july 1997 , the fourth international colloquium on grammatical inference will be held from july 12 through july 14 , 1998 , at iowa state university in united states . topics of interest the conference seeks to provide a forum for presentation and discussion of original research papers on all aspects of grammatical inference including , but not limited to : * different models of grammar induction : e . g . , learning from examples , learning using examples and queries , incremental versus non-incremental learning , distribution-free models of learning , learning under various distributional assumptions ( e . g . , simple distributions ) , impossibility results , complexity results , characterizations of representational and search biases of grammar induction algorithms . * algorithms for induction of different classes of languages and automata : e . g . , regular , context-free , and context-sensitive languages , interesting subsets of the above under additional syntactic constraints , tree and graph grammars , picture grammars , multi-dimensional grammars , attributed grammars , parameterized models , etc . * theoretical and experimental analysis of different approaches to grammar induction including artificial neural networks , statistical methods , symbolic methods , information-theoretic approaches , minimum description length , and complexity-theoretic approaches , heuristic methods , etc . * broader perspectives on grammar induction - - e . g . , acquisition of grammar in conjunction with language semantics , semantic constraints on grammars , language acquisition by situated agents and robots , acquisition of language constructs that describe objects and events in space and time , developmental and evolutionary constraints on language acquisition , etc . * demonstrated or potential applications of grammar induction in natural language acquisition , computational biology , structural pattern recognition , information retrieval , text processing , adaptive intelligent agents , systems modelling and control , and other domains . program committee technical program chairs : vasant honavar and giora slutzki , iowa state university , usa . technical program committee : r . berwick , mit , usa a . brazma , european bioinformatics institute , cambridge , uk . m . brent , johns hopkins university , usa c . cardie , cornell university , usa w . daelemans , tilburg university , netherlands d . dowe , monash university , australia p . dupont , univ . st . etienne , france . d . estival , university of melbourne , australia j . feldman , international computer science institute , berkeley , usa l . giles , nec research institute , princeton , usa j . gregor , university of tennessee , usa c . de la higuera , lirmm , france a . itai , technion , israel t . knuutila , university of turku , finland j . koza , stanford university , usa k . lang , nec research institute , princeton , usa . m . li , university of waterloo , canada e . makinen , university of tampere , finland l . miclet , enssat , lannion , france . g . nagaraja , indian institute of technology , bombay , india h . ney , university of technology , aachen , germany j . nicolas , irisa , france r . parekh , allstate research and planning center , menlo park , usa l . pitt , university of illinois at urbana -

this is really a two fold question . let 's talk about the selling of report # 5599 first . all you have to do is place an ad , mail the postcards or send bulk email . if you place an ad send the respondent this sales letter and let this sales letter do the rest for you - no need to talk to anyone ! ! if you mail the postcards or use bulk emailing your job is done ! the postcard will ask the respondent to send $ 50 . 00 to your mailing address . email will work for you if you send it to as many people as you can . if you decide to become an offshore broker and qualify to receive over-rides and commission on the offshore business support services the parent company will do the selling for you if you wish . this is a " no brainer " and can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it . . . talk to the people if you wish or do n't - report # 5599 sells itself ! q . how many hours a week will i have to devote to my business ? a . one to sixty hours a week ! here 's a question i will answer with a question . . . how much money do you want to make ? common sense says the more ads you run and the more mailings you do the more money you will make ! the statistics show that for every 100 responses you receive from your ads , and you mail this sales letter , you will sell five to ten reports making you $ 250 . 00 to $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . your ad responses will vary depending on the place you advertise and the circulation of the publication . the more ads you run or the more emails you send out the more time you will need to devote to your home based business . q . just how much money will i need to start my home based business ? a . $ 50 . 00 ! yeah i know - you ' re thinking you will need money for ads and mailing . well - i ' ve had people start with $ 50 . 00 ( u . s ) and make ten copies of the report and sold them to their associates and friends giving them $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . that gave them enough money to start running ads and to buy stamps . in looking at all the money making opportunities offered in the world today i really do n't think you can get started for any less than $ 50 . 00 and have a better legitimate money-making opportunity than the one offered in report # 5599 ! q . if i have additional questions who will answer them for me ? a . i will or the parent company will ! no package of information , no matter how complete , can possibly answer every question that may come up . i do not want you to lose money seeking out the answers . i want you to succeed !

ham i wish to make some comments on an issue that recent discussion of nostratic and the problem of " demonstrating " distant genetic relationships has skirted around that i believe underlies some of the issues that various people have been directly addressing . an assumption that seems to underly much of the discussion is that hypotheses regarding genetic relationships are not interesting unless they can be proven to be true . i find this a rather odd assumption , and one that does not seem to be made about any other kinds of hypotheses in linguistics ( or anywhere else in science as far as i know ) . and let us set aside for the sake of argument the oft-noted point that the notion of proof is not really applicable to empirical hypotheses , and assume that the term is to be used loosely for some arbitrary high level of certainty . it seems fair to say that there is a fairly widespread disinterest in hypotheses like the nostratic hypothesis because it is widely believed ( and i will assume it is true here for the sake of argument ) that the available evidence for nostratic falls short of this imaginary level of certainty which deserves the label " proven " . a common type of reaction to unproven hypotheses is that it has not been demonstrated that the observed similarities might not be due to chance and / or borrowing . but suppose that someone were to take the same attitude towards comparative reconstruction of protolanguages . suppose that someone were to object to comparative reconstruction of anything but very shallow groups on the grounds that one can never prove that the reconstructions are correct . just as one can object to certain claims of genetic relationships on the grounds that one cannot conclusively eliminate the possibility that the observed similarities might be due to accident and / or borrowing , one could equally well object to virtually all hypotheses surrounding comparative reconstruction on the grounds that one cannot conclusively eliminate alternative possibilities . the comparative method is a way to come up with the best guess one can make about a protolanguage ; it never provides proof that the reconstruction is in fact correct . so why bother doing it ? the answer should be obvious : hypotheses which represent our best guesses at any point in time are what much of science is about . by why do so many linguists seem to object to applying the same way of thinking to hypotheses about genetic relationships ? why is it that many historical linguists find the hypotheses like the nostratic hypothesis either laughable or upsetting ? why do n't they react the same way to comparative reconstructions , since they also are " unproven " ? why do n't they rush out and read everything they can find on nostratic and conclude " the evidence is tantalizing but not conclusive ; it 's a really exciting hypothesis " ? why is there such a double standard ? i want to suggest an answer to this question , an answer which , if right , provides insight into the nature of many debates surrounding controversial hypotheses of genetic relationship . namely , some people find questions of genetic classification intrinsically interesting , quite apart from any detailed historical work that plays a role in supporting hypotheses . other people , however , are primarily interested in the detailed historical work itself , and do not find questions of genetic classification intrinsically interesting , but only interesting in so far as they are an inevitable consequence of historical work . people of the first sort are more likely to find recent work reclassifying penutian languages exciting , while people of the latter sort are unlikely to react that way , unless they are penutian specialists . as one moves back in time , the ability to apply the comparative method becomes increasingly difficult , and detailed historical work becomes increasingly speculative ( and to many historical linguists , dissatisfying ) . but at any time depth , we can always be much more confident of the genetic classification than we can of any comparative reconstructions . our confidence in indo - european as a language family is surely greater than our confidence in any specific claims about proto - indo - european . but as we move further back in time , we should expect there to be hypotheses that we cannot be entirely confident of , but for which there is at least some promising evidence , where any comparative reconstruction is going to be sufficiently speculative as to not be satisfying to linguists interested in traditional comparative work . and since these linguists are not interested in genetic classification except as a biproduct of detailed historical work , such linguists are likely to find the hypotheses uninteresting . on the other hand , for linguists who find questions of genetic classification inherently interesting , the fact that detailed historical work may not be possible is irrelevant , and the fact that the hypothesis is unproven or unprovable may be no more a source of concern than the fact comparative reconstructions are always unproven and unprovable . if this view is correct , much of the debate surrounding controversial hypotheses in genetic classification is based , not on substantive questions , but simply on what sorts of questions different people find interesting . matthew dryer

ham i have a problem : geoff 's posting sounds like it assumes ( a ) that there are only two sides to the issues under discussion and ( b ) that one of them is " orthodox " and the other one ( the i am on , apparently ) little short of crazy , the suggestion being that those who defend the idea that there are linguistic relationships to be discovered beyond the ones which were known in 1840 or some such cut-off date ( the so-called " remote " or " distant " connections ) might go so far as to accept that all of greenberg 's muskogean data are wrong and yet to maintain that muskogean is amerind ( without citing any new data ! ) . i think the reality is quite different . for example , victor golla , karl teeter , and i ( although we have been debating some methodological issues relevant to nostratic ) are actually very close on most issues ( except the ones under discussion , apparently ) and in particular on most issues concerning the proposed amerind grouping . there are lots of historical linguists with different ( and crossclassifying ! ! ) views on these matters ( for example , eric hamp has been widely quoted on his views against nostratic , yet he has been a staunch defender of altaic and of a connection between luoravetlan and eskimo - aleutian ; many of those who like nostratic do not like amerind ; and so on . i think each case deserves to be examined on its merits , the whole idea of contrasting " orthodox " ( or " mainstream " ) with " remote " or " distant " comparisons is without foundation and can lead to further needless polarization , and finally i feel that methodological issues and substantive ones should be discussed separately ( and that the latter are the more important , even if the former are often the more seductive ) . and to close on a positive note ( consonant with the spirit of the season ) , if karl teeter and i can reach the point where our major remaining disagreements are ( a ) whether in principle one could or could not write a comparative grammar of anglo - french , and ( b ) whether in fact the work done to date on nostratic is sufficient to taking it as a working hypothesis that at least indo - european , uralic , altaic , kartvelian , and afro - asiatic are related and going further , then i think we have achieved considerable progress ( and i am not even sure we even disagree about these points any more , for as the discussion goes on , more and more mutual misunderstandings seem to disappear ) . there will , of course , remain a lot of hard work to be done , on these and even more on other language families , but i do not see why the inevitable disagreements should be considered any more of a problem than the disagreements within the indo - europeanist community about the different versions of the laryngeal theory or about the glottalic theory , etc .
spam ( pardon this intrusion , you were mentioned as someone who would have an interest in technology ) we are in the beginning of an exciting , " trillion dollar emerging market " in technology . in the next 3 minutes below , i will show you how to capitalize on this extraordinary trend ! here 's the trillion dollar trend in american business that i ' m speaking of ! you may have noticed over the past few months the incredible number of billion dollar mergers in us business . huge mergers like worldcom and mci , travelers and citicorp - the list is endless but they one common thread - services , services , services ! ! services like : travel services , banking services , telephony services , entertainment services and utility services . all of these services that you , i and everyone we know use , are being combined into one , trillion dollar market of " bundled services " . services have been the fastest growing segment of the us economy for a number of years but this " bundled services " market is new . these are services that everyone uses - everyday , offered from one , simple source ! why are " bundled services " such a big deal ? let 's add it up : banking services = hundreds of billions travel services = hundred of billions telephony services = $ 200 billion in us , $ 1 trillion worldwide ( internet access , paging , cellular , long distance , local dial , cable tv , digital satellite , voice mail , virtual office , web tv ) utilities ( being deregulated now ) : electricity = $ 250 billion , gas = $ 70 bill . internet commerce = $ 8 billion ( projected to reach $ 350 billion in 5 years ) in short , " bundled services " are every conceivable service that you , i and everyone we know uses . a war is waging for these huge markets with the largest service companies in the world , and millions will be made from those entrepreneurs who position themselves in front of this trend . these service / technology companies are buying companies left and right so they can offer more services . these companies are fighting tooth and nail because they know something most of us do n't know . as a gte study reveals , when a customer enrolls on a single service they will stay on that service for an average of 2 years , with two services the average moves to 4 years . when a customer enrolls on 3 services , they will stay with that provider for an incredible average of 20 years ! imagine the cash flow on just one customer using 3 - 6-10 - 20 services , for 20 years . what would that cash flow be worth ? a whole bunch , and that 's why the race is on . the first company to get customers on 3 or more services - wins ! that 's why these service companies are spending billions in advertising to attract customers . but . . . these huge , traditional service companies have a serious problem . they can not get directly in front these customers . even if they could send someone directly over , would they find them at home ? if they were at home , would they let them in their house ? people decide on which service companies they wish to use , based on recommendations from people they know ! here 's my point : who better to make recommendations for services than from the people you know ! we do this unconsciously everyday anyway - now you can get paid for it ! we simply , and very passively , offer people we know , a " free package of services " designed to save them money and make their life simpler . the more they use the more they save ! this package will make their life easier with single billing for all the services they use . we can save them money by leveraging our parent companies $ 1 . 6 billion dollar buying power to offer the most competitive prices available anywhere for this package ! it gets even better ! we are not talking about no-name companies with questionable service . we are talking about the biggest service and technology companies in the world ! companies that are already a household name . these companies realize that " word of mouth " is the best way to get in front of customers . your associates & friends win , and you win ! they handle all the service / customer support - we just make the recommendation ( this could be as simple as passing out a brochure ) . services can create a true residual income ( no inventories here ! ) . what could an extra $ 10 - $ 50 , 000 a year do for your family - for the next 20 years ? with a more concentrated effort , the potential is " income replacement " and beyond . in addition to the monthly residual income you will earn on these services , you may also earn over rides on other re-marketers . the system of delivering services in the next evolutionary step in networking - we call it " internetworking " . the reason we call it " internetworking " is that everything can be accomplished via the internet . given the trillion dollar size of this untapped market , our financial backing and billion dollar partners , we project that we will be a billion dollar company and household name in 3 years . you are learning about us in the first 30 days ! timing is everything . imagine if you talked with an associate who has numerous property management contacts . let 's say this contact of yours knew several property managers who own thousands of rental units . the property management company could offer these services to thousands of tenants . the property management company earns a fortune , your associate earns a fortune and you earn a fortune . this is leveraged income ! there are hundreds of ways to market this because everyone uses these services . as a matter of fact , who do you know that would not be interested in saving money on their service bills , with the same top grade service companies and have the convenience of a single bill ? in summary , bundled services are a trillion dollar untapped market , ripe for entrepreneurs with vision . customers get the same quality service from the largest providers but now through one source ! because of our buying power and the fact you afford to give bigger discounts when customers are using more services ( bundled ) , it 's a win / win situation , and represents one of the largest business trends of this century . . . food for thought . . . social psychologists tell us that each person runs into at least two opportunities that could in fact , reshape their lives . the question here is this , is this your first opportunity or your last ? an interesting question . with a simple investigation , you will determine this opportunity and company , is for real . if you ' re too busy , that 's exactly why you need to do this . in three years or less , you can create the lifestyle you wish , with the effort of course . get the facts and make an informed decision . please visit our site now : http : / / www . vwcs . com / pauld thank you for your attention , the wave 4 group ps : this is a one time mailing
ham before christmas i sent a message to the list about a mac concordance program called monoconc . that program is now available as monoconc . hqx from the ftp site at rice university . to retrieve the program , ftp to ftp . rice . edu and connect to the directory pub / ling . monoconc is a spin-off of another program i have been working on , which is paraconc . paraconc is a concordance program that works with parallel texts , i . e . , two texts ( translations ) that have been aligned so that sentence number n ( or linguistic unit n ) in language a is lined up with sentence n in language b . paraconc itself does not do any alignment ; hence the texts must be aligned manually ( i . e . , with a word processor ) or by using another program . once each text is loaded into the program , a search can be performed . as with monoconc , a word , part-of - word , or phrase can be entered . the program produces a numbered key-word - in-context concordance based on the occurrence of the search term in text a . a second window displays the sentences in text b that contain the translations of the concordance lines . the concordance lines can be sorted 1l or 1r and the results can be saved or printed . i am making paraconc available to the academic community as a standalone shareware program . i would be happy to receive corpora ( parallel or single ) in exchange . corpora for our use at rice university or for distribution to a wider community are all welcome . paraconc is available by ftp from ftp . rice . edu in the directory pub / ling . the program ( on a disk ) and manual can be purchased from athelstan ( 800-598 - 3880 ) . questions , complaints , and requests for different versions of the software can be sent to me . i am also interested in making contact with other linguists working or thinking about working with parallel texts for research and language teaching . michael barlow dept of linguistics rice university barlow @ ruf . rice . edu

ham i would like to make a few comments on marilyn silva 's questions about control structures like ( 1 ) johnny asked the teacher to go to the bathroom . ( 2 ) johnny asked to go to the movies . which , at least for some native speakers , are acceptable and allow an interpretation with the matrix subject as the controller . i believe that the interpetation of these sentences is fully explainable in terms of speech act semantics ( no syntax needed here ) . first , it is clear that the person asked is a potential agent and that in the " unmarked " case the empty subject is also supposed to an agent supposed to perform some future action specified by the verb phrase on the infinitive clause . therefore , the first option is object control . in the case of ( 1 ) this preferential interpretation is overridden by other pragmatic factors , such as the relative social status of the participants ( student vs . teacher ) . it is relatively unlikely ( though not excluded ) that the student will ask the teacher to do something . therefore , it is seems reasonable to look for an alternative intepretation . in the case of ' ask ' = a reasonable antecedent of the understood subject is the the potential beneficiary of the request , i . e . the asker . the asker benefits from the potential action performed by the addressee of the request . johnny could certainly categorized as being the beneficiary of the situation " going to the bathroom " . thus it seems plausible to referentially link the empty subject of = the infinitive complement . similarly , for a sentence like ( 3 ) john asked paula to be assigned for the task . which seems to involve control switch , i . e . switch from object control to subject control . in this case the passive construction overtly signals that the empty subject cannot be an agent . therefore , it 's implausible to assume coreference between the empty subject and the matrix object . but both john and the empty subject are potential beneficiaries . well , not beneficiaries not in the sense of case grammar or theta-role theory but in the sense of speech act semantics . what seems to at work here is a principle of " role identity " , which has been worked out in some more detail in a recent article written by klaus - michael koepcke and myself in folia linguistica 27 . 57-105 . ( " a cognitive approach to obligatory control phenomena in english and german " ) . roles are not understood there in the sense of case grammar but as " pragmatic roles " . we also point out some interesting differences = between control in english and german , for example , that sentences like ( 4 ) der polizist bat , den saal zu verlassen . ( literally : the policeman asked to leave the room ) can only be interpeted as involving an " implicit controller " , i . e . an addresse or a set of addressees , which is not lexicalized . related issues are also discussed in my recent book " kontrollph = e4nomene im englischen und deutschen aus semantisch-pragmatischer perspektive " published by gunter narr verlag , tuebingen . by the way , koepcke and i found that native speaker 's intuitions in these matters are really very unreliable and that linguists should think of more serious ways of testing what is possible in a language and what is not . klaus panther , university of hamburg , germany
ham below are two coling - acl ' 98 workshop calls for papers : - the computational treatment of nominals - usage of wordnet in natural language processing systems they are seperated by : call for papers coling - acl ' 98 workshop " the computational treatment of nominals " august 16 , 1998 universite de montreal montreal / canada http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ federica / workshops / coling / call . html this workshop aims at bringing together researchers who are interested in the study of the computational properties of nominals and noun phrases . the focus is on representational questions as they relate directly to nlp requirements and applications . understanding the properties of the nominal system is extremely important since nouns and nominalizations are used extensively by both people and systems : searching and communicating with either a telegraphic or a more expressive language involves heavy use of nominal forms . a number of nlp applications , ranging from " intelligent " key-word search to text summarization and information extraction , among others , not only require some way of recognizing nominal forms , but also require at least a shallow understanding of the semantic information that nouns carry . it is therefore of great interest to consider what impact representing semantic knowledge at a finer level of granularity would have towards enhancing a system 's performance . submissions are invited on one or more of the following topics : * representation of nominals : o design of noun ontologies for use in lexical semantics and machine translation o ambiguity , polysemy , vagueness , and underspecification in the semantics of nominals o identifying the minimal requirements for lexical representations * representational issues in the acquisition of knowledge : o from corpora o from mrds o syntactic and morphological bootstrapping o semantic boostrapping ( role of prepositions , arguments , etc . ) * role of representations for the interpretation of nominals : o techniques for recovering implicit information in nominals o interpretation and generation of nominals in descriptions of events and abstract objects in discourse o recovering implicit semantic relations in nominal compounds o defining implicit semantic relations between nominalizations and the forms they are derived from organizing committee federica busa ( brandeis university ) inderjeet mani ( the mitre corporation ) patrick saint dizier ( irit , universite paul sabatier ) submission information * papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . * maximum length is 8 pages ( single-spaced ) including figures and references . * please use a4 or us letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . * use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . * latex users are encouraged to use the style file provided by coling-acl ' 98 : http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / colaclsub . sty * authors should send 5 copies in either electronic ( postscript or latex ) or hard-copy format to : federica busa computer science department volen center for complex systems brandeis university waltham , massachusetts 02254 u . s . a . federica @ cs . brandeis . edu criteria for selection will include clarity , originality , relevance , and significance of results . important deadlines * deadline for submission : march 15th , 1998 * notification of authors : may 1st , 1998 * final versions due : june 1 , 1998 program committee * federica busa ( brandeis university ) * jean mark gawron ( sri international ) * bob ingria ( psyche systems corporation ) * beth levin ( northwestern university ) * inderjeet mani ( the mitre corporation ) * paul portner ( georgetown university ) * james pustejovsky ( brandeis university ) * patrick saint dizier ( irit , universit = c8 paul sabatier ) * antonio sanfilippo ( sharp laboratories of europe ) * evelyne viegas ( crl , new mexico state university ) * piek vossen ( university of amsterdam ) -

derived ontologies ? * how can wordnet be used to develop a word sense disambiguation algorithm of high performance ? * how to extend wordnet for identifying thematic roles and resolving verb polysemy ? * what minimal customization should be implemented to use wordnet for a large-scale abductive reasoning system ? * is wordnet a lexical knowledge base that can be easily used to adjust information extraction systems across domains ? * are the lexico-semantic relations from wordnet a valid base for developing an extended coreference task for information extraction , and what are the possible methodologies ? * how can wordnet be mined to find textual implied information and what is the degree of plausibility of the returned information ? * what are the approaches of using the extensive linguistic knowledge of wordnet to derive the discourse structure of a text ; can it be the only knowledge source and if not , what additional knowledge may be used ? * what is the current performance boost provided by wordnet in the systems using it ? could your systems perform without wordnet ? * what are the desirable features of wordnet for your system , and what would be the predicted performance increase when having them ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ organizing committee the workshop is organized by sanda harabagiu ( sri international ) joyce yue chai ( duke university ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ home page : http : / / www . ai . sri . com / ~ harabagi / link _ paper / chpt / acl _ work . html _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ requirements for submission papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . maximum length is 8 pages including figures and references . please use a4 or us letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . latex users are encouraged to use the style file provided by acl : http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / colaclsub . sty papers can be submitted either electronically in postscript format , or as hardcopies . submissions should be sent to : sanda harabagiu sri international 333 ravenswood ave menlo park , ca 94025 u . s . a .

ham in agreement with some of the comments posted about " of " in " coulda " ( and let 's include hadda ) etc . , it is interesting to me that so many readers knowledgeable about linguistics see any more than a graphic convention attempting to represent the homophony of ' ve with " of " here . it leads to interesting questions about how spelling affects our " mental " lexical representations of words , as literate beings . however , it is questionable whether whatever " psychological reality " the spelling " of " in " could of " has for the literate will have any effect on the future of the language ( since that was brought up ) . i think the spelling " of " for unstressed " have " has about as much chance of making a verb of the other " of " as the spelling " we " would have of making french " oui " an english pronoun . the evolution of parentheses into phonological segments is perhaps more likely .

ham geoff pullum has raised the question of the null hypothesis with respect to proto - world and long-distance relatedness . i would suggest that the lack of progress in the dispute may be due in part to the conflict between two ways of setting the null hypothesis . a priori , in terms of evoutionary considerations , long range relationships going back to a single ancestor are to be expected : this point has been made by numerous linguists in discussion , if not so often in print . however , methodological considerations force us to set the null hypothesis the other way , since we clearly cannot disprove long-distance relatedness . the problem is analogous to medical disputes : there are plenty of researchers who would like to show once and for all that homeopathy , acupuncture etc . are of no benefit in the treatment of the illnesses for which such effects are claimed . but all that can be said is that we have no scientifically respectable evidence that homeopathy works ( please note that this is a purely methodological point - i do n't want to see linguist cluttered with replies disputing the homeopathic facts ! ) the greenbergian dispute is even less likely to be resolved by disproving long-distance relatedness hypotheses than the homeopathic one , since in the latter case one can at least do controlled trials : while there have been proposals on controlling for chance similarities , there will always be too many variables involved for the greenbergian null hypothesis to be refuted . steve matthews

ham adapting lexical and corpus resources to sublanguages and applications a workshop to be held at the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 26 may 1998 * * * * ( second announcement with extended deadline and new event ) * * * * the workshop will provide a forum for those researchers involved in the development of methods to integrate corpora and mrds , with the aim of adding adaptive capabilities to existing linguistic resources . organisers : roberto basili ( university of roma " tor vergata " ) , roberta catizone ( university of sheffield ) , maria teresa pazienza ( university of roma " tor vergata " ) , paola velardi ( university of roma " la sapienza ) , yorick wilks ( university of sheffield ) workshop scope and aims lexicons , i . e . , those components of a nlp system that contain " computable " information about words , cannot be considered as static objects . words may behave very differently in different domains , and there are language phenomena that do not generalize across sublanguages . lexicons are a snapshot of a given stage of development of a language , normally provided without support for adaptation changes , whether caused by language creativity and development or the shift to such a previously unencountered domain . the divergence of corpus usages from lexical norms has been studied computationally at least since the late sixties , but only recently has the availability of large on-line corpora made it possible to establish methods to cope systematically with this problem . an emerging branch of research is now involved in studies and experiments on corpus-driven linguistics , with the aim of complementing and extending earlier work on lexicon acquisition based on machine readable dictionaries ( mrd ) : data are extracted from texts , as embodiments of language in use , so as to capture lexical regularities and to code them into operational forms . the purpose of this workshop will be to provide an updated snapshot of current work in the area , and promote discussion of how to make progress . central topics will be ( though this list is in no way exclusive ) : * corpus-driven tuning of mrds to optimize domain-specific inferences , * terminology and jargon acquisition , * sense extensions , * acquisition of preference or subcategorization information from corpora * taxonomy adaptation , * statistical weighting of senses etc . to domains * use of mrds to provide explanations of linguistic phenomena in corpora * what is the scope of " lexical tuning " * the evaluation of lexical tuning as a separate task , or as part of a more generic task * * * * * new event : industrial panel * * * * * automatic adaptation of lexicons to new domains through the use of application corpora makes nlp applications more adaptable and portable . the program commettee is organizing a joint panel to discuss this ( and other ) issues concerning next generation information extraction systems . the panel intends to bring industrial representatives to confront expectations in ie from their viewpoint and degree of maturity of the offering . relevant issues that will be discussed are : is there a market for ie ? what is the demand in domains such as new services for the citizens , telecommunications , management support , etc ? what are the technical requirements ? is the technology near to the market ? program committee yorick wilks university of sheffield roberta catizone university of sheffield paola velardi university of roma " la sapienza " maria teresa pazienza university of roma " tor vergata " roberto basili university of roma " tor vergata " bran boguraev brandeis university sergei nirenburg new mexico state university james pustejowsky brandeis university ralph grishman new york university christiane fellbaum princeton university paper submission formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : paola velardi dipartimento di scienza dell ' informazione via salaria 113 00198 roma italy electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or word per mac or rtf . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to paola velardi ( velardi @ dsi . uniroma1 . it ) even important dates ( * * * * please note extended deadline * * * * ) paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) march 10 paper notification april 1 camera - ready papers due april 20 l&ct workshop may 26 prof . paola velardi dipartimento di scienza dell ' informazione via salaria 113 universita ' " la sapienza " 00198 roma ph . + 39 - ( 0 ) 6-49918356 fax + 39 - ( 0 ) 6-8541842 8841964

ham a couple of remarks on recent exchange on comparative method : 1 ) as far as importance of morphology is concerned i believe that alexis is right ( sorry , karl ! ) . it is important , but i think that it would be impossible to insist that only morphological prallels like latin est , sunt and german ist , sind cited by karl teeter can prove relationship . old church slavic has the parallel forms iest # and so ~ t # , perfectly agreeing with karl teeter 's latin and german . however , in modern russian the present of copula dissapeared ( we can still recognize forms like iest ' and sut ' , but they sound bitterly archaic ) : on student ( he [ is ] student ) , oni studenty ( they [ are ] stu - dents ) . let us imagine the situation when the only surviving slavic language is russian and we just do not have old church slavonic materials . does the lack of the paradigm make russian less " indoeuropean " than latin or german , or does it make impossible the proof of its ie nature ? i think that the answer is in the negative . second , alexis is certainly right when he says that a refusal to admit lexical evidence will make impossible to prove that mandarin is related to cantonese or that vietnamese is related to khasi . even worse , we won't be able to state that beijing mandarin is related to xi ' an mandarin , or that hanoi vietnamese is related to saigon vietnamese , as nothing resembling est , sunt / ist , sind can be found in these closely related dialects . moreover , we would have to dismantle the families of north and north east asia as well , since their agglutinative morphology also does not exhibit anything of the kind ie does . therefore , continuing this claim logically to its end , we will have to state that there are around 50 unrelated languages in japan alone , because we have no possibility to prove the genetic relationship of various japanese dialects and subdialects , since they do not have a grammar like ie . there are cases when proof of genetic relationship is based mostly on grammar , but there are cases when it rests solely on lexical items , as well as there are lucky cases like ie when one can demonstrate the relatedness on the basis of both grammar and lexicon . absolutization of any of this cases may lead us to dismissal of pretty well established language families . the cases like " proto _ english - french " can actually be easily controlled by using basic voca - bulary in lexical comparisons : no matter how many romance words were borrowed b yenglish , its basic vocabulary is still germanic , which can be easily demon - strated , contrary to those who try to label the very idea of basic vocabulary as " semantic primitive " . 2 ) geoffrey pullum writes : ) i wonder if it would not be a good idea to hear something - - from the defenders of wide-ranging and large-time - depth comparison , prefererably - - concerning what would count as evidence against a genetic relationship ? the same things as in case of lower-level comparisons : either lack of regular phonetic correspondences , or lack of enough number of cognates , representing basic vocabulary items and / or basic morphological markers , established on the basis of these regular correspondences . this is why i , not being amerindianist myself , cannot believe in amerind : greenberg did not present any correspondences at all , and his whole method of " mass comparisons " is in direct violation of traditional and conservative comparative methodology . therefore , i would side with greenberg opponents on this matter . but i believe that it is absolutely unfair to put illich - svitych in one company with greenberg and ruhlen , as geoffrey pullum does in his posting . illich - svitych work starts with charts of phonetic correspondences , which do work regularly throughout his 3 - volume work , and is , therefore , in sharp contrast with greenberg 's " mass comparisons " . the whole work , at least in the areas i can judge of ( altaic and uralic ) is done with painstaiking care and accuracy , reflecting the state of the art , contemporary to the time when his work was done ( sixties ) . may be the opponents of long-range compa - rison should at last familiarize themselves with works of illich - svitych , dolgopol 's kii and others , which as i believe represent a successful long-range comparative work ( though it does not necessarily mean that i agree with all illich - svitych 's proposals : many things remain to be done ) , rather then to repeat the groundless allegations in illich - svitych address , and come forward with some concrete arguments against his work , rather than general statements that illich - svitych 's work is like greenberg 's or that there is a ceiling to the comparative method . sincerely , sasha vovin avvovin @ miamiu . acs . muohio . edu

" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was = done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you = go back to the guarantee , " you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal .

" threw it away " " i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . " dawn w . , evansville , in " no free lunch " " my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . ' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . " alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , " the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . " the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to " move up " or " get rich " , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with " no risk " and " just a little bit of effort . " you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! " think about it " before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 20 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 20 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 20 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 20 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 20 , 000 programs each for a total of 2000 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 20 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , now very legal , money making opportunity . it does = not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and = best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 90 days . before you say " bull " , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a now perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = 20 to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 usd cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number ( international orders should also include $ 2 usd extra for postage ) = 20 add your e amil address when sending in for your report this is for = 20 updated information and continueing support ( optional ) that will = 20 be handed down by your sponcers pipeline . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 " how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales " order report # 1 from : a . siegmund # 57 trakehnenstr . 13 53332 bornheim , germany _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 " major corporations and multi-level sales " order report # 2 from : j . maz 15774 s . lagrange rd suite # 312 orland pk , il 60462 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 " sources for the best mailing lists " order report # 3 from : b . thompson 13504 greencaslte ridge tr . 404 burtonsville md . 20866 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 " evaluating multi-level sales plans " order report # 4 from : muw # 2 po box 71442 salt lake city , ut 84171-0442 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion one of your free web sites can be registered at = http : / / www . freeyellow . com / . i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20 to 90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . = 20 = = = = = = 09 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - headers - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - return - path : received : from relay01 . mail . aol . com ( relay01 . mail . aol . com = [ 170 . 31 . 108 . 127 ] ) by air21 . mail . aol . com ( v37 . 0 ) with smtp ; mon , 22 dec = 1997 12 : 34 : 39 - 0500 received : from bonaly . hw . ac . uk ( bonaly . hw . ac . uk [ 130 . 195 . 251 . 5 ] ) by relay01 . mail . aol . com ( 8 . 8 . / 8 . 8 . / aol - 4 . 5 . 0 ) with smtp id maa19336 ; mon , 22 dec 1997 12 : 29 : 50 - 0500 ( est ) date : mon , 22 dec 1997 12 : 29 : 50 - 0500 ( est ) from : ziaza99 @ sh . hit . no received : from 007 ( sdn-ts - 047mdrelrp11 . dialsprint . net ) by = bonaly . hw . ac . uk ( mx v4 . 2 axp ) with smtp ; mon , 22 dec 1997 17 : 29 : 48 + 0000 ( gmt ) to : ziaza99 @ sh . hit . no comments : authenticated sender is subject : freefree web site now message - id : = 09 = = 20 - - = 20
ham as a british speaker of a quasi-standard variety , i was a bit puzzled by tony bex 's assertion that british speakers do n't use _ _ coulda _ _ . if he means the spelling , that 's probably true . but i think i use the sound sequence / kud6 / ( 6 = schwa ) quite a lot in conected speech when the following word begins with a consonant ( especially an obstruent ) . also , i wonder whether labelling this issue a matter of ' native speaker intuitions ' may not be slightly misleading . after all , the phenomenon in question was that / 6v / is frequently spelt _ of _ after words like _ could _ by less highly literate writers . surely this is n't an intuition , any more than spelling the plural with _ 's _ ( potato 's etc . ) is an intuition . furthermore , if greengrocers or anybody else use that spelling , we presumably would n't want to say that for them the plural is a kind of possessive morpheme . so i doubt that mis-spellings can be taken as evidence for the purported grammatical intuition that / 6v / is a verb preposition or whatever . earlier contributors to the debate have seen it as a matter of spelling tending to lose distinctions between homophonous morphemes . whose to say their not write ? richard ingham

- but how can we perceive those regularities ? - and how do we reason on the basis of that knowledge if there are no observable constraints on infererring ? - but if there are , where do they come from and how are they actually implemented mentally ? - and finally : how do we come to act rationally , that is , in accordance with what we have perceived , processed and inferred . we are interested in all ways of defining rules and in all aspects of rule following , from the definition of law , rule , regularity , similarity and analogy to logical consequence , argumentational and other inferences , statistical and linguistic rules , practical and strategic reasoning , pragmatic and praxeological activities . we expect contribution from the following research fields : game-theory , action theory , argumentation theory , cognitive science , linguistics , philosophy of language , epistemology , pragmatics , psychology and semiotics . we would be happy to include some contributions from natural sciences such as neuro-biology , physiology or brain sciences . the conference is organized in three major sections : philosophy , psychology and linguistics with six keynote lectures . then contributions of 30 minutes ( 20 for paper and 10 for discussion ) will follow . we also plan to organize a workshop at the end of each section abstracts : abstracts should be one-page ( maximum 23 lines ) specifying area of contribution and the particular aspect of rule-following to be addressed . abstracts should be sent by e-mail to : tarnay @ btk . jpte . hu or bocz @ btk . jpte . hu . hard copies of abstracts may be sent to : laszlo tarnay department of philosophy janus pannonius university , ifjusag utja 6 , h-7624 pecs , hungary important dates : deadline for submission : march 15 , 1998 notification of acceptance : march 25 , 1998 conference : april 30 - may 1 - 2 , 1998 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * for those concerned there is a follow-up philosophical colloquium : john mcdowell : mind and world - kant in analytic philosophy which discusses mcdowell 's recent book : mind and world . among would-be participants are barry allen , michael williams and robert brandon . if interested , contact prof . janos boros , dept . of philosophy , janus pannonius university . e-mail : boros @ btk . jpte . hu

ham dear linguists , in the december 15 issue of linguist i posted a request for examples of deictic expressions for the names of days either side of " today " . here is the summary of what i obtained . the response was overwhelming - a total of 70 linguist subscribers sent replies . many , many thanks to all of you who contributed . quite a number of respondents supplied information on two or more languages . there was some duplication of languages , namely japanese , mandarin chinese , danish , french , german , russian and hindi . i now have examples of 48 languages , they are : anejom ( vanuatu ) , a = fee a = fee ( solomon is ) , azerbaijani turkish , basque , bauan ( standard fijian ) , brazilian portuguese , bulgarian , czech , danish , dutch , english , erromagan ( vanuatu ) , estonian , finnish , french , german , hausa , hawai ` ian , hindustani , ipili ( png ) , italian , japanese , kamhmu ? ( vietnam ) , ki - swahili , kope ( png ) , korean , lao / phasa iisaan , lenakel ( vanuatu ) , madarin chinese , malay , mauritian / seychelles creole , modern greek , modern hebrew , norwegian , polish , quechua , rumanian , russian , samoan , serbo - croatian , slovene , sulka ( png ) , swedish , taiwanese , thai , welsh . my original interest in collecting such deictic expressions stems from a general interest in symmetry in language and language systems . most languages exhibit a symmetry in the number of deictic expressions for diurnal units either side of " today " , however , some exhibit an asymmetry . c . s . levinson ( pragmatics , 1983 : 75 ) reports , " the amerindian language chinantec has four named days either side of today ; japanese has three days back from today , and two ahead ; hindi has the same word for yesterday and tomorrow . " ( levinson gleaned this information from : fillmore , c . j . ( 1975 ) . santa cruz lectures on deixis , 1971 . mimeo , indiana university linguistics club . ) i have not personally been able to get a hold of this the fillmore reference - living in the academically isolated south seas does have some drawbacks ! if any of you have a copy of this publication , i would be very interested in obtaining photocopies of the section on ` time deixis ' . of course , i will reimburse you for the cost of postage and photocopying . anyway , a symmetrical deictic system of diurnal units / spans seems to me logical , though i ' m not sure i can verbalise the reasons . the reported asymmetry in the japanese system seemed to me a bit odd . especially that the asymmetry was lop-sided towards the past ( see below for reasons ) . upon further examination , i discovered that the japanese deictic system for diurnal units does seem to be symmetrical ; it has + 3 and - 3 either side of the present diurnal span . the expression ` siasatte / yanoasatte ' meaning + 3 days from " today " is not known to quite an number of native speakers of japanese . they appear to be used infrequently and ` yanoasatte and yaneasatte ' are considered to be dialectal ( at least in relation to the tokyo dialect ) . indeed , the lecturer in japanese in my department ( herself a native speaker of japanese ) was not aware of these expressions until she looked them up in her dictionary . another interesting consideration in all of this is the question as to the number of diurnal units before and after today that languages recognise . what is the maximum / minimum number of units ? also , what is the average number of units ( or most popular system ) ? answers to these questions ( based on my small sample ) below . one respondent asked the following very interesting question : " if you reach the level of , let 's say , 5 ( days after present diurnal span ) , does this also have the non-specific reading ` at some point in the not-to - far-away future ' in those languages ? " the only language in my small corpus that has + 5 and - 5 diurnal units in its system is erromangan ( vanuatu ) . i will have to ask my source for erromangan to answer this question . there is an inherent problem in determining the number expressions for diurnal units . this is determining whether the expressions are lexemes or phrases . many languages seem to have " lexicalised " ( for want of a better term ) prepositional / nominal phrases . other languages , like for example the english expression ` the day before yesterday ' , have retained the phrase structure . one respondent supplied me with a lengthy discussion on the lexeme / phrase issue . she cites the case of bulgarian ( i hope she won't mind my including her discussion here ) : [ begin quote ] bulgarian presents an [ interesting ] situation with regard to the phrase / lexeme issue because it does n't have a real nominal case paradigm : onzi den - 2 ( lit . " that / yonder day " ) vchera - 1 dnes 0 present diurnal span utre + 1 vdrugi den + 2 ( lit . " other day " ) so the same form ' pozavchera ' in bulgarian ( with stress on the penultimate syllable ; russian ' pozavchera ' has stress on the final syllable ) perhaps does n't look as strange because one would n't expect ' po ' to require any particular case ending . however , again we have what looks like a preposition with an adverb , which should not exist as a phrase . bulgarian " tomorrow " is ' utre ' . but " the day after tomorrow " is ' vdrugiden ' - - i . e . , the phrase ' v drugi den ' ( lit . " on ( the ) other day " , written without spaces in between the individual words . should this be considered a word simply on orthographic grounds , though ? is it a prepositional phrase or an adverb ? of course the boundary between prepositional phrases and adverbs is very fuzzy to begin with . bulgarian " the day before yesterday " , in contrast , is what looks like a noun phrase : ' onja den ' - - " that day " . no preposition ' v ' ( " on " ) here . so should this be considered just an np or a prepositional phrase ? ' onja den ' is used the same way as ' vdrugiden ' - - ' vidjax go onja den ' - - " i saw him [ on ] the day before yesterday " . it seems to me that what 's written as a noun phrase here is really an adverb , like ' vdrugiden ' or like russian ' pozavchera ' and ' poslezavtra ' , the only difference being that the other three adverbs are formed from prepositional phrases while ' onja den ' has no preposition . it would sound strange to call it a prepositional phrase , because , unlike ' vdrugiden ' , it contains no preposition . so i would call it an adverbial phrase . ( time expressions in slavic languages are commonly in the accusative , and that may be the origin of ' onja den ' , but since modern bulgarian has lost its nominal case paradigm for the most part this makes it harder to determine the status of phrases like this one . ( cf . russian ' kazhduju nedelju ' ( " each - acc week - acc " ) , which means " every week " in an adverbial sense . ) bulgarian does n't have specific words for " the day before the day before yesterday " - - that would be , i think , ' v denja predi onja den ' ( " on the day before the day before yesterday " ) , but of course speakers would avoid that and just would say ' predi dva dena ' ( " two days ago " , lit . " before two days " ) . the same would be true for ' vdrugiden ' - - ' v denja sled vdrugiden ' is conceivably possible ( " on the day after the-day - after-tomorrow " ) , but speakers would say 's led dva dena ' ( " in / after two days " ) . so i think it may be very difficult here to draw a demarcation line here between the grammatical categories of words vs . phrases . [ end of quote ] quite a number of languages ( especially slavonic and germanic languages ) allow recursion of prepositions / prefixes to " add on " to the already existing deictic expressions . the extent to which this recursion can be practiced is limited only by pragmatic constraints . here are some nice examples : rumanian : ras-ras - ras-alaltaieri ( ? ) - 5 ras-ras - alaltaieri ( ? ) - 4 ras-alaltaieri - 3 alaltaieri - 2 ieri - 1 azi / astazi 0 present diurnal span miine + 1 poimiine + 2 ras-poimiine + 3 ras-ras - poimiine ( ? ) + 4 ras-ras - ras-poimiine ( ? ) + 5 etc . dutch : ( eer-eergisteren ) + 3 eergisteren + 2 gisteren - 1 vandaag 0 present diurnal span morgen + 1 overmorgen + 2 ( over-overmorgen ) + 3 danish : ( i for-forgars - 3 ) i forgars - 2 i gar - 1 i dag 0 present diurnal span i morgen + 1 i overmorgen + 2 ( i over-overmorgen + 3 the - 3 and + 3 forms are rather colloquial , but nevertheless perfectly idiomatic . further recursions of prefixes / prepositions are only used in jocular ways , and predominantly by children . finally , if you have read this far , you are about to be rewarded with a summary of the data i have at this point . number of diurnal units either side of " today " : symmetrical deictic systems - 1 0 + 1 no examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 23 examples - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 14 examples - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 3 examples - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - erromangan ( vanuatu ) asymmetrical deictic systems - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 3 examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 1 example - malay - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - hausa - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 1 example - colloquial spanish ( southern spain ) it 's interesting to note that no language in the sample employs the - 1 0 + 1 system . and the majority of asymmetrical systems are lop-sided towards the + side of the present diurnal span . why this should be so , i do n't know . however , this sample is very small and perhaps a larger sample would show no such lop-sidedness towards the + " today " side . are the languages that show a lop-sidedness in a state of change ? most languages have a symmetrical vowel system e . g . the same number of front vowels as back vowels . however , there are quite a number of languages with asymmetrical vowel systems . what lies behind this asymmetry ? the answer to this question may lie in the following scenario [ from : crowley , t . ( 1992 ) an introduction to historical linguistics , oup , pp . 200-201 ] suppose that in a language with a nice symmetrical five vowel system : i u e o a the vowel / e / beocomes raised towards / i / and ultimately merges merges with / i / . the resulting asymmetrical system : i u o a will put structural pressure on the system , and , in time , it would not be surprising to see / o / merging with / u / . if a system becomes asymmetrical ( or uneven ) so as to create some sort of ` gap ' , then a change is likely to take place as a way of plugging that ` gap ' , thereby re-establishing an even ( or symmetrical ) system . if this is indeed a natural process in phonological systems , perhaps analogous processes occur in other systems , like temporal deictic systems . a language with an asymmetrical temporal deictic system may be in the process of historical change and the ` gap ' plugged in due time . japanese may be a language that is in the process of losing its + 3 deictic term . if this is indeed the case , it would be interesting to see whether , in due course , this " imbalance " is " balanced " again by the loss of its - 3 deictic term . i do n't know how valid any of this is , i ' m just speculating . anyway , back to symmetry . the most symmetrical system of all is that found in hindi : tarso - 4 narso - 3 parso - 2 kal - 1 aaj 0 present diurnal span kal ( bihaan ) + 1 parso + 2 narso + 3 tarso + 4 where there are not only an equal number expressions for diurnal units either side of " today " , but the expressions on either side are the same . distinction between " before today " and " after today " is made through use of past or future tense of the verb . in looking at a language 's temporal deictic system i guess we must not fail to take account of a number of important linguistic / cultural aspects . among these would be : * the culture 's view of time . is it a linear view or a cyclical view ? * the language 's tense / aspect systems . * the historical development of its deictic expressions in short , we can't study deictics in isolation . we must look at how it meshes grammatically with the language . i would be very interested in any of your views on the reasons for symmetry and asymmetry we find in this area of deixis . also , if you are interested in adding to my list of languages , i 'd be very grateful to receive your contribution . thanks again to all those generous people who sent me so much interesting data and opinions . yours today , tomorrow and . . . jan tent department of literature and language school of humanities the university of the south pacific p . o . box 1168 suva fiji tel : ( 679 ) 313900 ext . 2263 fax : ( 679 ) 305053 e - mail : tent _ j @ usp . ac . fj = 09
